By Rearrangement Inequality, in any optional permutation, if $$$i&lt;j$$$ and none of $$$p_i$$$ and $$$p_j$$$ are equal to $$$i$$$ or $$$j$$$, then we must have $$$p_i&lt;p_j$$$.

This implies that in an optimal permutation there are very limited possibilities for the last few elements of the permutation.

Update the smallest K of the a_i, or 2. Update the smallest (K-1) of the a_i, and then use the last update to update a neighbour of the largest of the updated a_i.<\/p><p>We can split the 2nd strategy into two: if K=1, then the final update is to the largest of the original a_i if K&gt;1, then the final update will be to a neighbour of a_i already updated with value 1e9.<\/p><p>The final diameter of the graph is  min( 2*smallest a_i, max of smaller neighbours a_i, a_i+1 )<\/p><p>So overall we have to calculate 4 numbers: v11 \u2014 strategy 1 \u2014 2*smallest of updated a_i v12 \u2014 stratgey 1 \u2014 max of smaller of the a_i and a_i+1 v21 \u2014 strategy 2 \u2014 2*smallest of updated a_i v22 \u2014 stratgey 2 \u2014 max of smaller of the updated a_i and a_i+1<\/p><p>diameter for strategy 1 is min(v11,v12) diameter for strategy 2 is min(v21,v22)<\/p><p>We pick the strategy for the larger diameter, so the final answer  max( min(v11,v12), min(v21,v22) )<\/p><p>In the code:  v22 is cnt \u2014 initially calculated for K=1, and overwritten with 1e9 if K&gt;1  v21 is expressed as 2ll*vec[k-1].ff  min(v21,v22) is put into &quot;ans&quot;<\/p><p>The smallest K values of a_i are identified by populating and sorting vector&lt;pair&lt;ll,ll&gt;&gt; vec. Then we explicitly update the a_i array.<\/p><p>v12 is calculated in maxi2 in a loop that looks at the neighbours min(a[i], a[i+1]); v11 is picked up from 2ll*vec[0].ff and we have maxi2 = min( maxi2, 2ll*vec[0].ff ) to calculate min(v11,v12).<\/p><p>The final output  cout &lt;&lt; max( ans, maxi2) selects the diameter from the better of the two strategies.<\/p><\/div>","comment_rating":0,"problem":"D","label":"HintExp","timestamp":1660474039000,"round_id":"\/contest\/1712","round_name":"Codeforces Round 813 (Div. 2)"},"https:\/\/codeforces.com\/blog\/entry\/105919?#comment-942904":{"id":942904,"father_id":942755,"username":"\/profile\/1BeeNY1","text":"<div class=\"ttypography\"><p>Nice.

Then either the entire matrix is filled with 0s, or there exists a 1 that can be covered by an L-piece that also covers 2 zeros. The nice thing is that even after covering this 1, the property must continue to hold, so there is another 1 that can be covered by a single L-piece that also covers 2 zeros, and so on. As a result, if there are $$$k$$$ 1s in the matrix, then we can perform $$$k$$$ operations to zero them all, covering exactly one 1 with each operation. Try this out with Sample Input #2.<\/p><p>But if you don't have two 0s aligned (horizontally, vertically or diagonally) at first, then you have to place the first piece in an area with two 1s (if a 0 exists), or in an area with three 1s (if there is no 0 at all initially).

When I read the equation to determine beauty of subsegment, I thought it's max(a) \u2014 min(a) + max(a[l:r]) \u2014 min(a[l:r]). So my intuition to that problem is we want the subsegment to be as long as possible since we can include more elements for the max of the subsegment to be bigger and min to be smaller.

Naively, this is $$$dp$$$ solution is $$$O(n^2)$$$. <\/p><p>The main intuition behind the speedup to this problem is that, when comparing two numbers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in their binary representation, the only important digit $$$k$$$ is the first digit where they differ. Conveniently, there are only 30 possible values of $$$k$$$. This motivates us to use a binary trie that stores prefixes, and for each prefix we can keep track of the maximum $$$dp$$$ value where some bitstring with said prefix exists. <\/p><p>However, how do we know if for some digit $$$k$$$, the required configuration of $$$j$$$ and $$$a_j$$$ such that we satisfy the inequality $$$a_j \\oplus i &lt; a_i \\oplus j$$$? Let's do some casework and see if that simplifies anything. <\/p><p>Case 1: $$$k$$$ is off in both $$$i$$$ and $$$a_i$$$. <\/p><p>In this case, to satisfy the inequality, we want the kth bit to be set in $$$a_i \\oplus j$$$ but not $$$a_j \\oplus i$$$, so the kth bit should be set in $$$j$$$ but not in $$$a_j$$$. We can then update $$$dp_i$$$ accordingly. To figure out which subtree of the trie we should descend to, note that the prefixes of $$$a_j \\oplus i$$$ and $$$a_i \\oplus j$$$ should remain identical, so we want the status of $$$k$$$ in $$$a_j$$$ and $$$j$$$ to be the same. This raises a little bit of a problem, since this is two subtrees that we must visit. For now, lets look at the other cases.<\/p><p>Case 2: $$$k$$$ is off in $$$i$$$ but on in $$$a_i$$$:<\/p><p>In this case, to satisfy the inequality, $$$k$$$ should be off in both bits. The subtrees that we must descend to (so we can find answers where the differing digit between $$$a_j \\oplus i$$$ and $$$a_i \\oplus j$$$ is greater than k) are those where $$$k$$$ is on in one of $$$j$$$ or $$$a_j$$$ but off in the other.<\/p><p>Case 3: $$$k$$$ is on in $$$i$$$ but off in $$$a_i$$$: <\/p><p>Here, to satisfy the inequality, we want the kth bit to be on in both bits. The subtrees that we should descend to are those where the $$$k$$$ bits differ.<\/p><p>Case 4: $$$k$$$ is on in both bits. <\/p><p>And lastly, for this case, the kth bit should be on in $$$a_j$$$ but off in $$$j$$$. The subtrees that we should descend to are the ones where the kth bits are the same.<\/p><p>We can notice one major observation so that we only visit one subtree, instead of $$$2$$$: only the value of $$$a_j \\oplus j$$$ matters, since we wish to make the prefixes indentical. <\/p><p>However, then there is the final question of, for the subtree that we don't visit, how do we know if the maximum $$$dp$$$ value is valid? For example, if we are on the kth bit where it is off in both $$$i$$$ and $$$a_i$$$, the maximal $$$dp$$$ value may have some configuration where the kth bit is on in $$$a_j$$$ and not $$$j$$$. This will obviously cause $$$a_j \\oplus i$$$ to be greater than $$$a_i \\oplus j$$$. Well, thankfully, there are only 2 possible configurations for such a subtree where $$$a_j$$$ and $$$j$$$ differ in their kth bit: either $$$a_j$$$ has the kth bit set and $$$j$$$ doesn't, or $$$j$$$ has the kth bit set and $$$a_j$$$ doesn't. Similarly, for the subtree where $$$j$$$ and $$$a_j$$$ have the same status for their kth bit, there are only two cases: either it is set in both or off in both. So we can keep track of such $$$dp$$$ values separately.<\/p><p>So, our trie nodes only need to know: The child where the next bit is indentical in $$$a_j \\oplus j$$$, the child where the kth bit differs, and the maximum dp values for the case where the kth bit is on in $$$j$$$, and the case where the kth bit is off.<\/p><p>When we are finished processing $$$i$$$, all we have to do is insert it into the trie and update the max $$$dp$$$ values accordingly. Then we can move on to $$$i+1$$$. The answer should obviously be the max value of $$$dp_i$$$ for all $$$i$$$. <\/p><\/div>","comment_rating":28,"problem":"D2","label":"SolutionExp","timestamp":1660864709000,"round_id":"\/contest\/1720","round_name":"Codeforces Round 815 (Div. 2)"},"https:\/\/codeforces.com\/blog\/entry\/106136?#comment-944974":{"id":944974,"father_id":944695,"username":"\/profile\/RDFZzzx","text":"<div class=\"ttypography\"><p>Never mind, the whole contest is really enjoyable, and the problems are interesting (I like C and D1 best).<\/p><\/div>","comment_rating":5,"problem":"Irrelevant","label":"Irrelevant","timestamp":1660864851000,"round_id":"\/contest\/1720","round_name":"Codeforces Round 815 (Div. 2)"},"https:\/\/codeforces.com\/blog\/entry\/106136?#comment-944979":{"id":944979,"father_id":944948,"username":"\/profile\/Omer223","text":"<div class=\"ttypography\"><p>Our goal will be to calculate $$$dp[i]$$$, which is the longest valid subsequence starting at index $$$i$$$.

In that case we have to increase this value. So the best way to do is by doing $$$d - k$$$ operations of choosing $$$1 \\times 1$$$ matrices and setting some values.<\/p><p>Now, if $$$d \\ge k$$$, it can be proven that the answer is at max $$$2$$$. Let's prove it. Choose a submatrix of size $$$L$$$ from the top left corner such that colouring the entire submatrix to some new colour makes the new value of $$$d$$$ at least $$$k$$$. We will choose the maximum possible such $$$L$$$. Since $$$L$$$ is the maximum possible, if we increase it by even one more, we will end up getting $$$d &lt; k$$$. This means that the extra row and extra column that we are adding by shifting from $$$L$$$ to $$$L + 1$$$ contains a some distinct values that makes the value of $$$d$$$ cross over $$$k$$$ in a big jump. We only need to change some of these values. So we are looking from small jump instead of this big jump.<\/p><p>So instead of changing these extra values from the top left, let's try to change them from the bottom right i.e. in our second operation we will choose a different submatrix such that it's bottom right corner lies at $$$(L, L)$$$ (the intersection of the row and column that makes all the difference). Notice, that we can tweak the size of this second operation submatrix to our own choice such that we can make a jump as close as possible to $$$k$$$. Increasing the length of this submatrix, can atmost create a difference of $$$2$$$ (one in row and one in column). So we can land our $$$d$$$ at $$$k$$$ or at $$$k - 1$$$. If we land at $$$k$$$, we're good to go but if we land at $$$k - 1$$$, we will still be good to go since, we can change the colour of this second operation to some new colour altogether which will increment our $$$d$$$ to $$$k$$$.<\/p><p>So it has been proven that we can obtain the final state in atmost two operations.<\/p><p>Let's first define a term I'll call complete coverage. A submatrix $$$S$$$ is said to completely cover a value $$$v$$$ if the complement of the submatrix (w.r.t. the original matrix) does not contain the value $$$v$$$ at all. Another term, I'll define is bounding box. The bounding box of a value is the smallest matrix that completely covers it.<\/p><p>Now, we have to find out whether we can get the answer in one operation or not else the answer will be two. For the one operation that we want to do, we can iterate over the length $$$len$$$ of the submatrix of the operation and check whether there exists a submatrix such that treating it as our operation gives us the final state. For each possible length, we can iterate over all the possible values in the matrix and figure out which submatrices of size $$$len$$$ will completely cover this value. If we find a submatrix which completely covers exactly $$$d - k$$$ or $$$d - k + 1$$$ values, we can do 1 operation on this submatrix and get the new value of $$$d$$$ to be equal to $$$k$$$. We can do this in $$$O(n^2)$$$ time using 2D Lazy Addition using Prefix Sums (explained below). So this gives a total of $$$O(n^3)$$$ time complexity.<\/p><p>For finding the number of complete coverages for each submatrix, what we can do is we can represent the submatrix firstly by just it's top-left cell. Now, for each value, we can calculate it's bounding box. We will use 2D Lazy Update on the extreme corners of this bounding box to add 1 (the submatrices of length $$$len$$$ that contain this bounding box have 1 more value completely covered). And then we can calculate 2D prefix sum to get the final number of complete coverages.<\/p><p><a href=\"https:\/\/codeforces.com\/contest\/1720\/submission\/168927765\">Submission<\/a><\/p><\/div>","comment_rating":17,"problem":"E","label":"SolutionExp","timestamp":1660896233000,"round_id":"\/contest\/1720","round_name":"Codeforces Round 815 (Div. 2)"},"https:\/\/codeforces.com\/blog\/entry\/106136?#comment-945107":{"id":945107,"father_id":944695,"username":"\/profile\/Bovmelo","text":"<div class=\"ttypography\"><p>My solution to the misunderstood version of D1 has come out.
