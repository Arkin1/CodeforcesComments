((944900, 944906)) <<===>> but in the question they mentioned that take L shape such that one square at corner is left .  [<<<new_com>>>]
((944906, 944921)) <<===>> I do not understand your remark.If there are two zeroes in a 2 by 2 submatrix and at least a one is still present in the grid, you are certain to be able to remove a single one in a single step, by including two zeroes in the L shape. Thus the answer will be the number of one in the grid.Otherwise, if there is at least one zero in the grid, you will be able to remove only two one in one step, by including a zero in the L shape. Then, you are left with the first case, so you just removed an extra one in the first step. The answer is the number of one in the grid, minus one.Finally, if there are no zeroes in the grid, your first step will remove two extra ones. The answer will be the number of one in the grid, minus two. [<<<new_com>>>]
