((944830, 944850)) <<===>> Maybe it's due to the floating-point error.Try to compare  (code)  and  (code)  to compare  (code)  and  (code) .Don't forget to use bigger data type such as  (code) ! [<<<new_com>>>]
((944850, 944871)) <<===>> yeah I think I too made this error [<<<new_com>>>]
((944830, 944857)) <<===>> Never use doubles and floats if you can avoid it. [<<<new_com>>>]
((944830, 944867)) <<===>> Floating Point precision error. Try this test case:  (code) It should return 1, since you need to multiply the first numerator by 0, but your code seems to print 0, because it incorrectly calculated the first fraction as 0 due to precision errors.  [<<<new_com>>>]
