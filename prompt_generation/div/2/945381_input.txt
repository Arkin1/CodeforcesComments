((-1, 945381)) => <div class="ttypography"><p>I love constructive div 2 E's where the key observation is answer turns out to be at most [small number] like 2. Other recent examples like <a href="https://codeforces.com/contest/1686/problem/E">794 E</a> and <a href="https://codeforces.com/contest/1689/problem/E">798 E</a> though these are different kinds of problems. But I wonder how you come up with these constructions or guesses that you can the construction can be done in a small number of moves because it seems like the problem is easily hit or miss if you don't see the idea or think this is possible.</p></div>
