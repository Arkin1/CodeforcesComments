((-1, 945381)) <<===>> I love constructive div 2 E's where the key observation is answer turns out to be at most [small number] like 2. Other recent examples like 794 E and 798 E though these are different kinds of problems. But I wonder how you come up with these constructions or guesses that you can the construction can be done in a small number of moves because it seems like the problem is easily hit or miss if you don't see the idea or think this is possible.
