((-1, 945071)) => <div class="ttypography"><p>Hi, can someone explain why my submission for D2  <submission link>  has an MLE for test case 2? As far as I'm concerned, the memory complexity is $$$O(n\log10^9)$$$, which should be good, but it doesn't pass the memory. I've tried to make the code as clean as possible, so I'd appreciate it if someone could take a look.</p><p>My solution basically uses a trie, and to consider the value of the bitstring of $$$a_i \oplus i$$$ as we traverse down the trie. Most of the memory complexity thus comes from the set of indices that I store in each trie node, indicating that these indices $$$i$$$ at this node have the same prefix in the bitstring $$$a_i\oplus i$$$. Thanks!</p></div>
