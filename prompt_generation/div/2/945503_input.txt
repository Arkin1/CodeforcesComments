((-1, 945503)) <<===>> Is problem B statement clear?? It was told that we can take any valid subsegment satisfying r-l+1<n. That means I can take any subsegment with length less than or equal to n-1. But solution does not follow it as I could take the max value of the array with the second minimum value. Please clear to me if I missed something, I tried ton solve this for so many hours.
