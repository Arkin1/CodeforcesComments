((-1, 944798)) <<===>> In Problem-B it's mentioned that you cannot take subsegment of length = n (r — l — 1 < n) but it is taking subsegment of length=n as a correct solution, please let me know if I am wrong. [<<<new_com>>>]
((944798, 944807)) <<===>> In which test case ? [<<<new_com>>>]
((944807, 944812)) <<===>> I don't know in which test case, but i am getting it wrong considering max length=n-1, and i have seen some correct solutions considering max length=n [<<<new_com>>>]
((944812, 944827)) <<===>> u didn't take n size and the logic is simple behind it u just have to maximized last answer so for that reason u need only 4 index of sorted array first second last second lastthen i will just select any of two index which doesn't have n size actually i can make it using r-l+1<=n-1 just think [<<<new_com>>>]
((944827, 944829)) <<===>> 1 6 2 1 3 6 10 9 In this case, to satisfy your condition we have to take subsegment with l=1 and r=6 which is not satisfying r-l+1<n. Please tell me where am i getting it wrong? Thanks  [<<<new_com>>>]
((944829, 944835)) <<===>> we also take l=4,r=7, so we end with max(al....ar)=10 and min(al....ar)=1(1 base index)then we will get ans 9-1+10-1 [<<<new_com>>>]
((944829, 944838)) <<===>> Oh sorry, got it I misunderstood problem statement [<<<new_com>>>]
((944829, 944844)) <<===>> also an answer in this case (n=8) is l=3,r=7, 7-3+1<8  [<<<new_com>>>]
