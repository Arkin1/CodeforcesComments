<div class="ttypography"><p>I succeeded to solve D2 using bit tree on two values:  <submission link> . I struggle to evaluate the complexity of this solution. Can somebody explain it to me? I guess there is some countertest for getting TLE</p></div> <<===>> 
<div class="ttypography"><p>Yeah, same to you, except that I didn't implement this idea because of its confusing complexity. In normal Trie problem, we only need to choose one son (or we say direction) to go down. But here we might need to choose two out of four. </p><p>So one possible countertest is that: we sue the first half to construct a trie exclusively for one certain pattern. And then we repeat this pattern in the latter half so that we need to go through all the leaves in Trie constructed by first half.</p></div> <<===>>
