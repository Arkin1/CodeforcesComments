<div class="ttypography"><p>If a square with top left corner in $$$(x,y)$$$ completely covers number $$$c$$$ , let its side be equal to $$$L$$$, then for all $$$a_{i,j}=c$$$, $$$i-L+1\le x\le i,j-L+1\le y\le j$$$.Thus, we just care about the maximum and minimum values of $$$i,j$$$.After getting these values,we will add $$$1$$$ to each top left corners of squares which following above conditions,which can be done by offline prefix sums.</p></div> <<===>>
