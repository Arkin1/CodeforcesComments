((-1, 944839)) <<===>> Didn't get the 'C' problem. Can anyone explain? [<<<new_com>>>]
((944839, 944849)) <<===>> Suppose you have two 0s that are next to each other, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Then either the entire matrix is filled with 0s, or there exists a 1 that can be covered by an L-piece that also covers 2 zeros. The nice thing is that even after covering this 1, the property must continue to hold, so there is another 1 that can be covered by a single L-piece that also covers 2 zeros, and so on. As a result, if there are $$$k$$$ 1s in the matrix, then we can perform $$$k$$$ operations to zero them all, covering exactly one 1 with each operation. Try this out with Sample Input #2.But if you don't have two 0s aligned (horizontally, vertically or diagonally) at first, then you have to place the first piece in an area with two 1s (if a 0 exists), or in an area with three 1s (if there is no 0 at all initially). After that, however, the remaining 1s can be covered one at a time. Basically: if there exists two 0s aligned horizontally/vertically/diagonally, then the answer is the number of 1s initially. Otherwise, if there exists at least one 0, then the answer is (number of 1s) minus 1. Otherwise, if there is no 0, then the answer is (number of 1s) minus 2. [<<<new_com>>>]
