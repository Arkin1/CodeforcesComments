((-1, 944709)) <<===>> A was a bit too tedious for a task in such a place, and I think many contestants today gave up completely because they cannot finish A.All of the other problems are really nice, though. [<<<new_com>>>]
((944709, 944729)) <<===>> Didn't gave up. Tried till last minute. Yet couldn't manage to solve A :V  [<<<new_com>>>]
((944729, 944866)) <<===>> I just quit A, and thankfully I solved C, which I usually dont do in a div 2 [<<<new_com>>>]
((944709, 944823)) <<===>> Deciding to quit before submitting A is not giving up, it is strategy. [<<<new_com>>>]
((944823, 946208)) <<===>> I agree with you, I did this strategy in this contest. [<<<new_com>>>]
((944709, 945266)) <<===>> i was also stuck in first problem. [<<<new_com>>>]
((944709, 945366)) <<===>> It is a shame that I have been stuck in A for 1h. Luckly, I skip A and solve B&C in 20 minutes. [<<<new_com>>>]
