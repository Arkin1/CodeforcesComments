((-1, 945048)) <<===>> need to clarify if there is not such subsequence satisfying the condition, should we output 1 or 0 ? [<<<new_com>>>]
((945048, 945154)) <<===>> There will always be a subsequence satisfying the condition. Just pick any element, it is a subsequence of length 1. [<<<new_com>>>]
((945154, 945169)) <<===>> but it does not make sense for the inequality to hold if there is only one element [<<<new_com>>>]
