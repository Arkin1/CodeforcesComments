((-1, 944870)) <<===>> Didn't get the logic of i-512 in question D. Can anyone explain it in detail. [<<<new_com>>>]
((944870, 945196)) <<===>> I think 400 is clearer. Because we need $$$a_{j}$$$ ^ $$$i$$$ < $$$a_{i}$$$ ^ $$$j$$$ with $$$i>j$$$ and $$$i,j$$$ is belong to the subseqenuce. We have $$$a_{} \le 200$$$ï¼Œand operation xor can change the number +200 or -200 at most. So the extreme case is $$$i - 200 < j + 200$$$,then it is $$$j > i - 400$$$. [<<<new_com>>>]
((945196, 945271)) <<===>> It means for each j we have to iterate till i-400? [<<<new_com>>>]
((945271, 945556)) <<===>> It's just a easier solution for me. Its complexity is right. I learned we can use i-256 in this blog. [<<<new_com>>>]
((945556, 945655)) <<===>> Ok [<<<new_com>>>]
