((-1, 944845)) <<===>> Weak pretest for A, there wasn't even a test case in pretest with b==d and a and c being coprime, (or variant of it) and many answers got failed in system test due to that. I guess it is easy to have all such simple combinations for pretest., Especially for current A question. [<<<new_com>>>]
((944845, 944854)) <<===>> I actually think this is a good thing for Problem A when the logic is actually simple, since it punishes those who try to speedsolve it without actually thinking properly about whether their answer is correct, while also rewarding the careful solvers with an opportunity to hack them. I can understand the annoyance if it was a really tricky edge case, but for this one, the system tests that are destroying A submissions are stuff that the solver really should have considered before submitting, instead of being so impatient.

((944854, 944861)) <<===>> The point is pretest should represent minimum possible validation of correctness or trivial cases. And if the solution wrong, then penalty would do the job for wrong submission. [<<<new_com>>>]
