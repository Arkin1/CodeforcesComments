((-1, 945226)) <<===>> A simpler way to look at C.Just assume you have a 2x2 box containing all zeros. Now all the ones that surround the box can be used for one operation. Just choose the L such that 2 of the squares lie inside that box and one contains the new 1. So, we start with a 2x2 box containing the least number of ones.If 3 ones, answer = number of ones — 1. If 4 ones, answer = number of ones — 2. else answer = number of ones. (link to problem Irrelevant)  [<<<new_com>>>]
