<div class="ttypography"><p>A simpler way to look at C.</p><p>Just assume you have a 2x2 box containing all zeros. Now all the ones that surround the box can be used for one operation. Just choose the L such that 2 of the squares lie inside that box and one contains the new 1. </p><p>So, we start with a 2x2 box containing the least number of ones.</p><p>If 3 ones, answer = number of ones — 1. If 4 ones, answer = number of ones — 2. else answer = number of ones.</p><p> <submission link> </p></div> <<===>>
