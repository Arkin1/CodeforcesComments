((-1, 945218)) <<===>> I have a problem with task B. The condition says we can take any subarray. But then why for the input data "1 2 3 100 200" the answer is 297? We can take the subarray 2 3 100 200 and the answer will be 100 more than in the example. Or I don't understand something. Please explain. [<<<new_com>>>]
((945218, 945222)) <<===>> If we take the subarray 2 3 100 200, then the beauty of this subsegment is $$$200-2+1-1=198$$$. Why is the answer more than the example 100? [<<<new_com>>>]
((945222, 945225)) <<===>> omg. I understood... we exclude this sub-segment. aah, thanks! [<<<new_com>>>]
