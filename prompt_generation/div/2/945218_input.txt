<div class="ttypography"><p>I have a problem with task B. The condition says we can take any subarray. But then why for the input data &quot;1 2 3 100 200&quot; the answer is 297? We can take the subarray 2 3 100 200 and the answer will be 100 more than in the example. Or I don't understand something. Please explain.</p></div> <<===>> 
<div class="ttypography"><p>If we take the subarray 2 3 100 200, then the beauty of this subsegment is $$$200-2+1-1=198$$$. Why is the answer more than the example 100?</p></div> <<===>> 
<div class="ttypography"><p>omg. I understood... we exclude this sub-segment. aah, thanks!</p></div> <<===>>
