((-1, 944852)) <<===>> I hate to say this but I believe the statement for B isn't clear enough. When I read the equation to determine beauty of subsegment, I thought it's max(a) — min(a) + max(a[l:r]) — min(a[l:r]). So my intuition to that problem is we want the subsegment to be as long as possible since we can include more elements for the max of the subsegment to be bigger and min to be smaller. So what I thought was that the answer max of max(a) — min(a) + max(a[1:n-1]) — min(a[1:n-1]) and max(a) — min(a) + max(a[2:n]) — min(a[2:n]). (Here [l:r] both sides are inclusive) But it turned out to be different and I still can't turn my head around that. Only reason why I got to the answer was deducing from the sample explanation.

((944852, 945327)) <<===>> The reason it's different is that your formula is slightly wrong. Instead of the max and min of a, the first two terms should be the max and min of a excluding the subsegment [l, r]. Notice that in the equation for a subsegment's beauty, in the first two terms, the indices jump from l-1 to r+1. [<<<new_com>>>]
