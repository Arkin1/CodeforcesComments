((944948, 944972)) => <div class="ttypography"><p>We can build the longest subsequence iteratively by sweeping from $$$0$$$ to $$$n$$$ and finding the longest subsequence so far that our current index(lets call it $$$i$$$) can add on to. Naively, this is $$$dp$$$ solution is $$$O(n^2)$$$. </p><p>The main intuition behind the speedup to this problem is that, when comparing two numbers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in their binary representation, the only important digit $$$k$$$ is the first digit where they differ. Conveniently, there are only 30 possible values of $$$k$$$. This motivates us to use a binary trie that stores prefixes, and for each prefix we can keep track of the maximum $$$dp$$$ value where some bitstring with said prefix exists. </p><p>However, how do we know if for some digit $$$k$$$, the required configuration of $$$j$$$ and $$$a_j$$$ such that we satisfy the inequality $$$a_j \oplus i &lt; a_i \oplus j$$$? Let's do some casework and see if that simplifies anything. </p><p>Case 1: $$$k$$$ is off in both $$$i$$$ and $$$a_i$$$. </p><p>In this case, to satisfy the inequality, we want the kth bit to be set in $$$a_i \oplus j$$$ but not $$$a_j \oplus i$$$, so the kth bit should be set in $$$j$$$ but not in $$$a_j$$$. We can then update $$$dp_i$$$ accordingly. To figure out which subtree of the trie we should descend to, note that the prefixes of $$$a_j \oplus i$$$ and $$$a_i \oplus j$$$ should remain identical, so we want the status of $$$k$$$ in $$$a_j$$$ and $$$j$$$ to be the same. This raises a little bit of a problem, since this is two subtrees that we must visit. For now, lets look at the other cases.</p><p>Case 2: $$$k$$$ is off in $$$i$$$ but on in $$$a_i$$$:</p><p>In this case, to satisfy the inequality, $$$k$$$ should be off in both bits. The subtrees that we must descend to (so we can find answers where the differing digit between $$$a_j \oplus i$$$ and $$$a_i \oplus j$$$ is greater than k) are those where $$$k$$$ is on in one of $$$j$$$ or $$$a_j$$$ but off in the other.</p><p>Case 3: $$$k$$$ is on in $$$i$$$ but off in $$$a_i$$$: </p><p>Here, to satisfy the inequality, we want the kth bit to be on in both bits. The subtrees that we should descend to are those where the $$$k$$$ bits differ.</p><p>Case 4: $$$k$$$ is on in both bits. </p><p>And lastly, for this case, the kth bit should be on in $$$a_j$$$ but off in $$$j$$$. The subtrees that we should descend to are the ones where the kth bits are the same.</p><p>We can notice one major observation so that we only visit one subtree, instead of $$$2$$$: only the value of $$$a_j \oplus j$$$ matters, since we wish to make the prefixes indentical. </p><p>However, then there is the final question of, for the subtree that we don't visit, how do we know if the maximum $$$dp$$$ value is valid? For example, if we are on the kth bit where it is off in both $$$i$$$ and $$$a_i$$$, the maximal $$$dp$$$ value may have some configuration where the kth bit is on in $$$a_j$$$ and not $$$j$$$. This will obviously cause $$$a_j \oplus i$$$ to be greater than $$$a_i \oplus j$$$. Well, thankfully, there are only 2 possible configurations for such a subtree where $$$a_j$$$ and $$$j$$$ differ in their kth bit: either $$$a_j$$$ has the kth bit set and $$$j$$$ doesn't, or $$$j$$$ has the kth bit set and $$$a_j$$$ doesn't. Similarly, for the subtree where $$$j$$$ and $$$a_j$$$ have the same status for their kth bit, there are only two cases: either it is set in both or off in both. So we can keep track of such $$$dp$$$ values separately.</p><p>So, our trie nodes only need to know: The child where the next bit is indentical in $$$a_j \oplus j$$$, the child where the kth bit differs, and the maximum dp values for the case where the kth bit is on in $$$j$$$, and the case where the kth bit is off.</p><p>When we are finished processing $$$i$$$, all we have to do is insert it into the trie and update the max $$$dp$$$ values accordingly. Then we can move on to $$$i+1$$$. The answer should obviously be the max value of $$$dp_i$$$ for all $$$i$$$. </p></div>
((944948, 944979)) => <div class="ttypography"><p>Our goal will be to calculate $$$dp[i]$$$, which is the longest valid subsequence starting at index $$$i$$$. We will calculate $$$dp[i]$$$ in decreasing order of $$$i$$$. In addition, we will maintain a trie which somehow stores elements of the array / $$$dp$$$ values. The flow of our solution would be something like:</p><p>a) For $$$0 \le i \le n - 1$$$: (decreasing)</p><p>a1) Calculate $$$dp[i]$$$ based on previous $$$dp$$$ values, using our trie.</p><p>a2) Insert the $$$i$$$'th element to the trie, somehow.</p><p>The $$$O(n^2)$$$ $$$dp$$$ formula is something like: $$$dp[i] = max_{j &gt; i, a[i] \oplus j &lt; a[j] \oplus i}(dp[j] + 1)$$$. Therefore, we want to insert the elements into the trie in such a way that retrieving the maximal $$$dp[j]$$$ for all $$$j$$$ such that $$$a[i] \oplus j &lt; a[j] \oplus i$$$ is easy.</p><p>Recall that comparing two binary numbers can be done lexicographically.
