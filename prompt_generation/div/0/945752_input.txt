((-1, 945752)) <<===>> Can someone explain the Convex Hull Trick mentioned in E? I can't figure a way to calculate the minimum for each node without iterating over all other nodes to get $$$d_{new}[v]$$$ [<<<new_com>>>]
((945752, 945772)) <<===>> Its a somewhat advanced DP optimisation trick that allows you to optimise dp of the type $$$dp[i] = max_{j<i} dp[j] + cost(j, i)$$$ from $$$O(n^2)$$$ to $$$O(n log(n))$$$ by looking at each of the previously computed DP values as lines with decreasing slopes. You can find tutorial videos online, this is where I personally learned it [<<<new_com>>>]
((945752, 945788)) <<===>> You can also use Li Chao tree (it is just advanced segment tree) Both are data structures that allows you to find minimum/maximum of linear functions' values in O(log(n)) [<<<new_com>>>]
