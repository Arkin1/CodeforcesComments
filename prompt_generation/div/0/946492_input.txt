<div class="ttypography"><p>Could anyone help me find why this submission  <submission link>  which could be <code>O(32 * 32(m+n))</code> passes? The only difference is that I changed from a two-dimension vector to one-dimension vector, where bit information are added in edges instead of one-bit-one-graph. I have been thinking for the whole night. Thx...</p></div> <<===>>
