((-1, 945804)) <<===>> can someone tell the rating of the C problem ? [<<<new_com>>>]
((945804, 945809)) <<===>> I guess somewhere around 1700... [<<<new_com>>>]
((945809, 945811)) <<===>> ok thanks, it is harder than the usual Div2 C problems  [<<<new_com>>>]
((945811, 945813)) <<===>> Agree.I felt the same XD [<<<new_com>>>]
((945813, 946271)) <<===>> Excuse me, but I'm just curious about the meaning of "XD". [<<<new_com>>>]

((945811, 945848)) <<===>> I think C was reasonable for Div 2 since the only major (intellectually) hard part was figuring out how to compute the cost at the start. Transitions between queries were really simple (albeit long) and didn't require much thinking. [<<<new_com>>>]
