<div class="ttypography"><p>can someone tell the rating of the C problem ?</p></div> <<===>> 
<div class="ttypography"><p>I guess somewhere around 1700...</p></div> <<===>> 
<div class="ttypography"><p>ok thanks, it is harder than the usual Div2 C problems </p></div> <<===>> 
<div class="ttypography"><p>Agree.I felt the same XD</p></div> <<===>> 
<div class="ttypography"><p>Excuse me, but I'm just curious about the meaning of &quot;XD&quot;.</p></div> <<===>>
