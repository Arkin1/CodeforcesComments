((-1, 946045)) <<===>> In problem E, I'm facing a weird issue, when I initialize the distance to all the arrays with >= 1e14, it gives WA on test case = 37, otherwise, it passed all the test cases. (link to problem E) Can someone help me?All that I'm changing between the two submissions is  (code)  [<<<new_com>>>]
((946045, 946102)) <<===>> [Removed, as it was an in invalid test case]. [<<<new_com>>>]
((946102, 946151)) <<===>> The test you provided isn't valid because $$$k$$$ must be at least $$$1$$$. In fact, when $$$k$$$ is at least $$$1$$$, taking a direct flight from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ is always an option, so the answer is bounded by $$$(n - 1)^2 < 10^{10}$$$. [<<<new_com>>>]
((946151, 946152)) <<===>> Sorry, my bad. I actually got a counter example locally, but it was too big to analyze, hence I manually tried to set $$$k$$$ to 0 to verify Dijkstra. You're right that I forgot that a positive $$$k$$$ reduces the upper bound as well.  [<<<new_com>>>]
((946045, 946137)) <<===>> My guess is that you overflow in your  (code)  class.  (code) s and  (code) s can both overflow int, and so multiplication might overflow long long: (code) UPD: Changed  (code) s to  (code)  in your HullDynamic class, AC now:  (link to problem E)  [<<<new_com>>>]
