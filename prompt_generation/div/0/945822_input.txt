((-1, 945822)) <<===>> A solution I thought of for E was to use a segment tree, what you would do is take the old distance and add $$$i^2$$$ to each $$$a_i$$$, doing that and taking the minimum of the array gives the answer for $$$i = 0$$$, then for moving forward from $$$i-1$$$ to $$$i$$$, you add the AP -1,-3,-5.. To the suffix and ...5,3,1 to the prefix â€” essentially adjusting the square terms we added. For this we of course need a segment tree that can add an AP to a range and take the minimum of all elements, can anyone confirm if that's possible? If it is can you point me to some resource?
