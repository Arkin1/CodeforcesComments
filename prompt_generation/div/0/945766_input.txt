((945766, 945793)) <<===>> Your solution failed because: 1. The lower bound for s would be b * k (handled properly) 2. The upper bound for s would be b * k + n * (k — 1) (your code does not handle this properly).As, after setting first element to b * k, you can still add k — 1 to each element of the array.Counter Test Case: 1 2 3 1 6Correct Answer: (5, 1) or (4, 2) Your Code output: -1 [<<<new_com>>>]
