((-1, 946037)) <<===>> I'm having an hard time understanding the normal proof of problem A. Case 3 doesnt match with the description, it should be $$$(n-1) + (m-1)$$$ moves for Megan and either $$$n-1$$$ or $$$m-1$$$ for Stanley. In case 1 and case 2, Stanley has to make at least, respectively, $$$m$$$ and $$$n$$$ moves (and not $$$m-1$$$ and $$$n-1$$$). [<<<new_com>>>]
