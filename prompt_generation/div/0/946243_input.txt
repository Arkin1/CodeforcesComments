((-1, 946243)) <<===>> Can anyone help me find out why my solution didn't pass for D ?Here's my solution: for each index 1<= i <=n, let's find the bits that must be set to zero. Now let's iterate over the array starting from the last element, for each element we will only consider the statement that include another element with smaller index. For each statement that include that element, let's set to 1 all of the bits that are set to 1 in the OR value and can be set to 1 in the current index, the other bits will be set to 1 in the other element since we can't set them in the current one.Here is a link to my submission:  (link to problem Irrelevant) Any help will be more than appreciated.
