((-1, 945878)) <<===>> In problem E, could anyone explain the Dijkstra part mentioned in the editorial? How to transfer from "ending with air travel" to "ending with a usual edge"? [<<<new_com>>>]
((945878, 945888)) <<===>> My solution of E:Let's just use Dijkstra algorithm with only roads. Now repeat next thing k times:For each v:dp[new_layer][v] = min(dp[previous_layer][v], minimum_of(cost_of_flight + dp[previous_layer][from]))Run Dijkstra on updated distancesAnswer for vertex i after k repeats is dp[k][i]Submission using Li Chao tree for finding minimum_of():  (link to problem E)  [<<<new_com>>>]
((945888, 945905)) <<===>> What does it mean to "Run Dijkstra on updated distances"? How is it different from normal Dijkstra? [<<<new_com>>>]
((945905, 945921)) <<===>> It is not any different. You have some precounted distances, use them instead of INF you use usually and run usual Dijkstra  [<<<new_com>>>]
