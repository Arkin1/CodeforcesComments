<div class="ttypography"><p>For Problem E2 : It is mentioned as <code>Since i&lt;j&lt;k, a triplet is bad only when lcm(i,j,k)=k or (lcm(i,j,k)=2â‹…k and i+j&gt;k)</code> but there is no explanation like why it is true or how do the author arrive to this condition. <a class="rated-user user-orange" href="/profile/Vladithur" title="Master Vladithur">Vladithur</a> Can you explain this ? Like its is easy to observe that if lcm(i, j, k) = k then it would be bad, but for 2k I am not sure. Also why not the values in between k and 2k. </p></div> <<===>>
