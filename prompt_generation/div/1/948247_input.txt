((-1, 948247)) <<===>> For Problem E2 : It is mentioned as  (code)  but there is no explanation like why it is true or how do the author arrive to this condition. Vladithur Can you explain this ? Like its is easy to observe that if lcm(i, j, k) = k then it would be bad, but for 2k I am not sure. Also why not the values in between k and 2k.  [<<<new_com>>>]
