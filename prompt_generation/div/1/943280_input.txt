((-1, 943280)) <<===>> Problem D(Empty Graph) tutorial help. Can someone please explain the second proof or the below paragraph from the tutorial? I will be thankful to you!!"2. The diameter of the graph is equal to max1≤i≤n−1d(i,i+1)=min(max1≤i≤n−1min(ai,ai+1),2⋅min(a1…an)). Proof: since the minimum of a subsegment can only decrease when it's length increases, it is optimal to look only at the distance between two adjacent vertices."What does it mean " the minimum of a subsegment can only decrease when its length increases" ? and how are we coming to an intuition where considering d(i,i+1) is an optimal choice [<<<new_com>>>]
