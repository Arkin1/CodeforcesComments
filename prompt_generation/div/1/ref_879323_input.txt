<p>In Problem D,</p> <p>I am not getting why the length of the middle segment should be power of 2 for the optimal solution.</p> <p>Can someone help?</p> <<===>> 
<p>I also don't understand this</p> <<===>> 
<p>It's not the middle segment that should be a power of $$$2$$$. We iterate on the size of the middleweight category, which has to be a power of $$$2$$$.</p> <<===>>
