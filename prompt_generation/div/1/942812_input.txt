((-1, 942812)) <<===>> Bonus solution of C. Sort Zeroes, when a[i]<0, we traverse from the left of the array [n-1 till 0] , we break the moment we find a[j]>a[j-1], now we know j is the index up to which all the ai values need to be zero. Still, there may be chances that some elements within [0,j] may also be within [j+1, n-1] ( think why? ) to check that, we maintain a set of unique elements within [0,j], and once again traverse from [n-1 till j+1] and break the moment we find an a[i] which already exists within the set of unique elements from [0,j], now once again maintain the set of unique elements till the index of the last break. The answer is equal to the size of the new unique elements set. [<<<new_com>>>]
