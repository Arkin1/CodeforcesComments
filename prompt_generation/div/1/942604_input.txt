((-1, 942604)) <<===>> If the formal proof is quite hard, then why is it problem B ?Do you expect people to solve without proof ? [<<<new_com>>>]
((942604, 942609)) <<===>> That's a mistake on my part, I started wondering about the formal proof only on the day of the round, and it turned out to be unexpectedly difficult. [<<<new_com>>>]
((942604, 942614)) <<===>> Do you expect people to solve without proof ? That's what people usually do... [<<<new_com>>>]
((942614, 942625)) <<===>> Yes, but if you guess it wrong, you're gonna get huge amount of penalties and waste a lot of time. [<<<new_com>>>]
((942614, 942656)) <<===>> Yea, but for most easy problems usually the gap between intuition and formal proof is not this large. Most of the time all you need to do is to formalize your intuition to turn it into a complete proof, which is definitely not the case for this problem. [<<<new_com>>>]
((942604, 942620)) <<===>> Do you really think that those 13062 participants got Accepted on B all with proofs? :) [<<<new_com>>>]
((942620, 942650)) <<===>> Of course not, it's bad that they solved it without proof. My point is, for easy questions, make the proofs easy too. [<<<new_com>>>]
((942650, 943330)) <<===>> Or Make the problem with easy proofs. >_< (XD) [<<<new_com>>>]
((942604, 942685)) <<===>> While I do think that it may not be appropriate for div2B when the proof is so difficult, I think it's quite intuitive that the optimal result arises when big numbers are paired with big numbers, leaving small numbers paired with small numbers (as opposed to pairing big numbers with small numbers). Even without that intuition, trying it on a few small examples should quickly demonstrate this trend. Add in the observation that adjacent numbers have a GCD of 1 (so none of the factors are "wasted" by the LCM) and we have a straightforward solution that's very easy to implement. I didn't prove it during the contest myself, and that did cause me to hesitate before submission, but the intuition was strong enough that I decided to go ahead anyway.  [<<<new_com>>>]
((942685, 943030)) <<===>> But the intuition was strong enough that I got +2 :( [<<<new_com>>>]
((943030, 943033)) <<===>> I think your intuition was correct, but you simply didn't test odd values. The 1 should have been at the beginning, not the end. [<<<new_com>>>]
((942604, 942762)) <<===>> rearrangement inequality, and the fact: x and x+1 are coprimes, is a little bit hard to proof but the intuition helps. Sadly many Competitive programmers don't like maths [<<<new_com>>>]
((942604, 943260)) <<===>> i just wrote brute force and saw the pattern for (1 to 9) ;) it was just swap(arr[i],arr[i-1]) from back.... [<<<new_com>>>]
