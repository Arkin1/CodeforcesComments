((-1, 943017)) <<===>> In problem E how can I find this $$$\frac{(r - l + 1) \cdot (r - l) \cdot (r - l - 1)}{6}$$$ . [<<<new_com>>>]
((943017, 943064)) <<===>> It's just $$$C_{r - l + 1}^3$$$ â€” the number of ways too choose three elements from $$$r - l + 1$$$ elements (if we don't care about the order).  [<<<new_com>>>]
