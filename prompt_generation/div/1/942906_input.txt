((-1, 942906)) <<===>> About Bonus Problem of C  If any $$$a_i$$$ is $$$\le 0$$$ and any $$$a_j$$$ is $$$ \ge 0 $$$ such that $$$j<i$$$ , then all numbers from $$$a_1$$$ to $$$a_i$$$ have to be converted to 0. (Because $$$a_j$$$ will always be $$$ \ge 0$$$ ) Hence we can convert the array such that either all negative number are changed to $$$0$$$ or all negative number are on the left side of the array. Then we can apply the original problems's solution.  [<<<new_com>>>]
