<div class="ttypography"><p><strong>About Bonus Problem of C</strong></p> <ul>   <li>If any $$$a_i$$$ is $$$\le 0$$$ and any $$$a_j$$$ is $$$ \ge 0 $$$ such that $$$j&lt;i$$$ , then all numbers from $$$a_1$$$ to $$$a_i$$$ have to be converted to 0. (Because $$$a_j$$$ will always be $$$ \ge 0$$$ )</li>   <li>Hence we can convert the array such that either all negative number are changed to $$$0$$$ or all negative number are on the left side of the array.</li>   <li>Then we can apply the original problems's solution.</li> </ul></div> <<===>>
