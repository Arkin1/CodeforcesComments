((947593, 948214)) => <div class="ttypography"><p>Because the main idea of the model solutions is the same in both versions, E2 just uses a data structure to speed up the last part of the solution, which you don't need to use in E1.</p></div>
((948214, 948242)) => <div class="ttypography"><p>Thanks, it would be really helpful if you can mention this information at the start of the tutorial for E2. Or rather one should have made the editorial for E1 because I think people usually solve in order so they won't look up into E2 before they have solved E1 expecting that E2 must have a different solution.</p></div>
