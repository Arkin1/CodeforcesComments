((-1, 947593)) <<===>> Why tutorial for problem E1 is missing? [<<<new_com>>>]
((947593, 948214)) <<===>> Because the main idea of the model solutions is the same in both versions, E2 just uses a data structure to speed up the last part of the solution, which you don't need to use in E1. [<<<new_com>>>]
((948214, 948242)) <<===>> Thanks, it would be really helpful if you can mention this information at the start of the tutorial for E2. Or rather one should have made the editorial for E1 because I think people usually solve in order so they won't look up into E2 before they have solved E1 expecting that E2 must have a different solution.
