((-1, 942800)) => <div class="ttypography"><p>For prob D can someone explain this TC?</p>  <code> <p>My solution is to replace the 2nd and 6th values with $$$10^9$$$. So the diameter here would be $$$d(2,6) = 4$$$ (going through one of the nodes with value 2), but the expected result is 2. Am I missing something here?</p></div>
((942800, 942802)) => <div class="ttypography"><p>The length of the edge connecting node $$$2, 6$$$ is $$$2$$$, because $$$\min{a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6} = 2$$$.</p></div>
