((-1, 942800)) <<===>> For prob D can someone explain this TC?  (code) My solution is to replace the 2nd and 6th values with $$$10^9$$$. So the diameter here would be $$$d(2,6) = 4$$$ (going through one of the nodes with value 2), but the expected result is 2. Am I missing something here? [<<<new_com>>>]
((942800, 942802)) <<===>> The length of the edge connecting node $$$2, 6$$$ is $$$2$$$, because $$$\min{a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6} = 2$$$. [<<<new_com>>>]
((942802, 942855)) <<===>> Oh shit I misunderstood the problem for the whole night. Thank you! [<<<new_com>>>]
