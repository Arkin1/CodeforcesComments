<p>question statement of problem B says "You are given a decimal representation of an integer x". Initially, I didn't get that the input in problem B is a string or an integer....?</p> <p>firstly, I have tried my solution with an integer and got runtime error in test case 3 and later have tried with a string as input and my solution got accepted.</p> <p>Moral: <strong>a decimal representation of an integer x is a String</strong>.</p> <<===>> 
<p>Correct Moral: read constraints carefully next time.</p> <<===>> 
<p>can you explain how with help of constraints we came to know that we have to input a string . Sorry for the silly question though!</p> <<===>>
