((-1, 942801)) <<===>> In fact, we can prove in E1, $$$j = \frac{2}{3}k$$$ if $$$\operatorname{lcm}(i, j, k) = 2 \cdot k$$$ and $$$i + j > k$$$. So we can solve this problem in complexity $$$\mathcal O(n \sqrt n + \sum_{i = 1}^n \sigma_0(i))$$$ per testcase, which is faster than the editorial.code  (link to problem E1)  [<<<new_com>>>]
((942801, 942888)) <<===>> Yes, but I don't really like number theory, so I didn't want to include more of it in the solution. [<<<new_com>>>]
