((-1, 942964)) <<===>> for E2. "Turns out that for the current constraints, for every k, we can iterate over all pairs of 1â‰¤i<j<k, where i and j are divisors of 2.k and check if the triplet is bad."Why can we do this? I know that the sum of number of factors of all numbers from 1 to n is O(nlogn), but here we are iterating over each pair of factors for every number, what is the bound for that? [<<<new_com>>>]
((942964, 942971)) <<===>> Judging by this answer, $$$\ll n \log^3 n$$$. [<<<new_com>>>]
