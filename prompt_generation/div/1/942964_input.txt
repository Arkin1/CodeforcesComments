((-1, 942964)) => <div class="ttypography"><p>for E2. &quot;Turns out that for the current constraints, for every k, we can iterate over all pairs of 1â‰¤i&lt;j&lt;k, where i and j are divisors of 2.k and check if the triplet is bad.&quot;</p><p>Why can we do this? I know that the sum of number of factors of all numbers from 1 to n is O(nlogn), but here we are iterating over each pair of factors for every number, what is the bound for that?</p></div>
