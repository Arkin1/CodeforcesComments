<div class="ttypography"><p>can you explain it as well plz?</p></div> <<===>> 
<div class="ttypography"><p>Try this for an explanation.</p><p>As discussed elsewhere, when doing an update of an a_i you should always update to 1e9. </p><p>There are two possible strategies for doing the K updates of the a_i: 1. Update the smallest K of the a_i, or 2. Update the smallest (K-1) of the a_i, and then use the last update to update a neighbour of the largest of the updated a_i.</p><p>We can split the 2nd strategy into two: if K=1, then the final update is to the largest of the original a_i if K&gt;1, then the final update will be to a neighbour of a_i already updated with value 1e9.</p><p>The final diameter of the graph is  min( 2*smallest a_i, max of smaller neighbours a_i, a_i+1 )</p><p>So overall we have to calculate 4 numbers: v11 — strategy 1 — 2*smallest of updated a_i v12 — stratgey 1 — max of smaller of the a_i and a_i+1 v21 — strategy 2 — 2*smallest of updated a_i v22 — stratgey 2 — max of smaller of the updated a_i and a_i+1</p><p>diameter for strategy 1 is min(v11,v12) diameter for strategy 2 is min(v21,v22)</p><p>We pick the strategy for the larger diameter, so the final answer  max( min(v11,v12), min(v21,v22) )</p><p>In the code:  v22 is cnt — initially calculated for K=1, and overwritten with 1e9 if K&gt;1  v21 is expressed as 2ll*vec[k-1].ff  min(v21,v22) is put into &quot;ans&quot;</p><p>The smallest K values of a_i are identified by populating and sorting vector&lt;pair&lt;ll,ll&gt;&gt; vec. Then we explicitly update the a_i array.</p><p>v12 is calculated in maxi2 in a loop that looks at the neighbours min(a[i], a[i+1]); v11 is picked up from 2ll*vec[0].ff and we have maxi2 = min( maxi2, 2ll*vec[0].ff ) to calculate min(v11,v12).</p><p>The final output  cout &lt;&lt; max( ans, maxi2) selects the diameter from the better of the two strategies.</p></div> <<===>>
