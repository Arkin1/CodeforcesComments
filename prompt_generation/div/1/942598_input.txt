((-1, 942598)) <<===>> the gap between C and D is too large. [<<<new_com>>>]
((942598, 942602)) <<===>> Maybe yes, but E1 was solvable, you could solve E1 instead of D [<<<new_com>>>]
((942598, 942603)) <<===>> We expected C to be a bit harder and D to be a bit easier. [<<<new_com>>>]
((942603, 942740)) <<===>> If you know Graph algorithms I think solving D would be easy however in general E1 is much easier [<<<new_com>>>]
((942740, 942752)) <<===>> maybe. But for me, I solve D in 30 min but solve E1 in 1h30min(failed to find 6 and 15's apperance, not familiar with the method). And I think D doesn't really have much to do with Graph Algorithms. [<<<new_com>>>]
((942752, 945132)) <<===>> Can you please explain the 6 and 15 case, cuz i dont understand it at all? [<<<new_com>>>]
((942740, 947875)) <<===>> No spoliers [<<<new_com>>>]
((942598, 942757)) <<===>> D isn't so hard, just D, like the ancient times, the C was easy let's gonna admit that  [<<<new_com>>>]
((942598, 942862)) <<===>> yes [<<<new_com>>>]
