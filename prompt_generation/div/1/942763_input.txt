((-1, 942763)) <<===>> I really think this round is quite exquisite. The bonus in every problem, the riddle in the beginning of each task(and ACGN lover here too!), and the nice problems.Though I was one of those who was stuck in problem D just in lack of a binary search while using a bad greedy, I still have to upvote the problem preparation for all involvers！Thankyou！ [<<<new_com>>>]
