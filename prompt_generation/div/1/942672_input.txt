((-1, 942672)) <<===>> Alternate proof of BAfter the first two paragraphs of the editorial, another way is to proceed by induction. By Rearrangement Inequality, in any optional permutation, if $$$i<j$$$ and none of $$$p_i$$$ and $$$p_j$$$ are equal to $$$i$$$ or $$$j$$$, then we must have $$$p_i<p_j$$$. In particular, if $$$p_i=n$$$, then we must have $$$i=n-1$$$ or $$$i=n-2$$$. In addition, setting $$$j=n$$$ gives $$$p_n=n-1,n-2$$$. This implies that in an optimal permutation there are very limited possibilities for the last few elements of the permutation. We can use induction to prove that the best possibility is $$$p_n=n-1$$$ and $$$p_{n-1}=n$$$, so then we can construct an optimal permutation this way. [<<<new_com>>>]
