((-1, 942738)) <<===>> Where does the "/6" and "/15" come from at problem E1? I ve seen this on many solutions. I guess its an optimization for finding all triplets i,j,k with a fixed k, but i dont undersand it. [<<<new_com>>>]
((942738, 942748)) <<===>> You will see, if(i==6 j==10 k==15), lcm(i,j,k)=30 < i+j+k, if(i==3 j==4 k==6), lcm(i,j,k)=12 < i+j+k, and you may enlarge i,j,k because if lcm(i,j,k) < i+j+k ,then X(lcm(i,j,k)) < X(i+j+k) ,since X is a positive integer.And why is the cases (i==6 j==10 k==15) and (i==3 j==4 k==6) ? That's because 1/5+1/3+1/2 > 1 and 1/4+1/3+1/2 > 1 [<<<new_com>>>]
((942738, 942755)) <<===>> This is for finding $$$(i, j, k)$$$ where $$$lcm(i,j,k)=2k$$$ and $$$i+j>k$$$.Note that because of the second condition, $$$\frac{k}{2} < j < k$$$. Since $$$j$$$ divides $$$2k$$$, $$$j$$$ must be $$$\frac{2k}{3}$$$.Using the second condition again, $$$\frac{k}{3}<i<\frac{2k}{3}$$$, which implies $$$i$$$ is either $$$\frac{2k}{5}$$$ or $$$\frac{k}{2}$$$.So the solution triplets in this case has the form $$$(\frac{2k}{5}, \frac{2k}{3}, k)$$$ (happens when $$$15$$$ divides $$$k$$$), or $$$(\frac{k}{2}, \frac{2k}{3}, k)$$$ (happens when $$$6$$$ divides $$$k$$$).

((942755, 942904)) <<===>> Nice. Thanks for the clear explanation. [<<<new_com>>>]
