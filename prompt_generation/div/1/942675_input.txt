((-1, 942675)) <<===>> for D: D = max(min(arr[i],arr[i-1]),2*min(arr[0..n-1])) Why do we need bs? [<<<new_com>>>]
((942675, 942835)) <<===>> As we can also update the arr at most k times and it is not optimal to just update the first k smallest values. You can also do it without binary search, but for me, binary search approach is simpler. [<<<new_com>>>]
