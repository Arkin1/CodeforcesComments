((-1, 943118)) <<===>> Any ideas about  (code) ? I have solved problem D, but I can't think of any approach for doing it for all k.Maybe Vladithur can create a separate blog post about the solutions of bonus problems. [<<<new_com>>>]
((943118, 943122)) <<===>> I'm too lazy to do that(As for the bonus of problem D, the basic idea is to extend the greedy solution. [<<<new_com>>>]
((943118, 943124)) <<===>> If we try to extend the greedy solution of D. The complexity reaches  (code) .  To find for any  (code)  we need to do  (code)  processing. I tried to think how to use the solution of  (code)  to solve for  (code) , But there seems a lot of casework, and even after that complexity still seems to be  (code)  in some worst cases. Can someone help me here ?  [<<<new_com>>>]
((943124, 943138)) <<===>> What I meant is that you process the values of $$$a$$$ in increasing order and then maintain a couple of sets / multisets to find the answer for every $$$k$$$. Try to find what information you need to know to get the answer for some $$$k$$$ (and is easy to maintain when you move on to $$$k + 1$$$). [<<<new_com>>>]
