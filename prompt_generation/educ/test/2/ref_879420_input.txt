<p>Hi , Can Anyone please point out what is wrong in my Approach for problem C . I have used a greedy approach while mantaining a stack that holds the index of all the monsters that i defeat by starting a spell somewhere between <code>a[i] and a[i-1]</code> . So if for the ith monster , lets say that it can be defeated by continuing to add 1 to the spell casted at the <code>i-1</code>th index until we reach the ith monster , so i directly do that , if i can defeat the current monster by starting from <code>1</code> again in between the time of the previous monster and the current , while pushing the index of the current element in the stack. So only 1 case is left where , i am not able to defeat my current monster even by adding 1 to the (i-1)th spell through the time <code>k[i]-k[i-1]</code> , in that case i start popping my element from the stack until i reach an index <code>x</code> where instead of starting my spell from <code>1</code> before x , if i had continued adding <code>1</code> from the <code>x-1</code>th spell , our current monster too could have been defeated . This also gives the minimum mana that we will need to defeat the current monster . I would really appreciate the help , here's my code :  <submission link> </p> <<===>>
