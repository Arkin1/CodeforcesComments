((-1, 906262)) <<===>> An interesting thing about problem b I found, the difference between the first element and the last element cannot exceed $$$n + 1$$$. as long as the difference is less than or equal to $$$n + 1$$$ the answer is always yes. I'm not the best at proofs, but I think this is because the greatest difference between a series of $$$n$$$ consecutive integers is always $$$n - 1$$$, and our operations can increase the first element by one and decrease the last element by one, thereby shrinking the maximum difference between elements by two at most. So if the maximum difference is greater than $$$n - 1 + 2$$$ then the answer is no. What I can't figure out is why the ones in the middle can always seem to fix themselves if this is true. Still, this solution works in $$$O(1)$$$.  (link to problem B)  [<<<new_com>>>]
((906262, 906345)) <<===>> Basically you are describing the same equation as the one in the solution: x[n-1]-x[0]-n+1 <= 2 <=> x[n-1]-x[0] <= n+1 I actually solved this like a dumb person by shifting x[0] to the right or keeping it where it is and checking if everyone of the next elements can be shifted to the proper position according to where x[0] is fixed. So my complexity is O(2n) = O(n). Still works since reading the input is also O(n), but my solution is roughly 3 times slower than necessary. From my understanding, the solution described by the creator of the problem refers only to how many gaps there are between the first and last elements. If there are 0 gaps we're done, if there's one we can just shift one side and connect it with the other and if there are 2 gaps we shift 2 "chunks" so that everything is connected. On the other hand, if there are 3 or more gaps (which will make the inequality you referred to become false), then if one thinks about it, he will realize that there is no way to shift those 3 or more "chunks" in a way that they can be consecutive. The O(1) solution blew my mind on how simple it was. This problem caused me to overthink :D [<<<new_com>>>]
