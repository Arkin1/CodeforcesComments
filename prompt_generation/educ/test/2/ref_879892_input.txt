<p>Hey all! So for problem D, the tutorial says:</p> <p>"So there is a greedy idea that the second segment should be as long as possible under the constraint that it doesn't exceed the fixed value. The intuition is the following. Consider the longest possible valid segment. Now take the last element away from it. We will have to invite one more participant to the middle division. And that element will also get added to the third segment, increasing its length. So potentially, you can only increase the required number of participants to invite."</p> <p>Would anyone be willing to explain this a little more? I don't quite get how the intuition works here... What if one large segment causes the third segment to not be a power of 2, but a smaller segment allows both the second and third segments to be powers of 2? </p> <p>E.g. let's say segment 2 + segment 3 has to have length 12. Then if segment 2 has length 5, segment 3 must have length 7 (so you need 4 extra people), but if segment 2 has length 4, segment 3 has length 8 so you don't need extra people so that would be a better solution right?</p> <<===>> 
<p>I guess your example is wrong here. The middle segment should be a power of 2 and clearly 3 isn't.</p> <<===>> 
<p>Thank you so much for your reply! I just have another question though, why does the middle segment's length need to be a power of 2?</p> <<===>> 
<p>Because lengths of all segments should be a power of 2 and greedily we should not use extra participants to make the second segment a power of 2.</p> <<===>>
