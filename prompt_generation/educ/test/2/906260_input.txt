((-1, 906260)) <<===>> I've known that F needed precalc,but I didn't solve it.qwq [<<<new_com>>>]
((906260, 906461)) <<===>> In fact, when $$$n > k^2$$$ holds, the answer is a $$$O(k)$$$-degree polynomial. So you can use lagrange interpolation to solve this problem without precalc. [<<<new_com>>>]
((906461, 906506)) <<===>> I see,probably. Could I see your code to understand further? [<<<new_com>>>]
((906506, 906536)) <<===>> You can see A-SOUL_Diana's Code.  (link to problem Irrelevant)  [<<<new_com>>>]
