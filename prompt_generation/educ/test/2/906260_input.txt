<p>I've known that F needed precalc,but I didn't solve it.qwq</p> <<===>> 
<p>In fact, when $$$n &gt; k^2$$$ holds, the answer is a $$$O(k)$$$-degree polynomial. So you can use lagrange interpolation to solve this problem without precalc.</p> <<===>> 
<p>I see,probably.</p> <p>Could I see your code to understand further?</p> <<===>> 
<p>You can see A-SOUL_Diana's Code.  <submission link> </p> <<===>> 
<p>thanks!</p> <<===>>
