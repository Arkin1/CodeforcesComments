<p>In Problem D, I ran 3 nested loops i, j, k for the power of 2 the first second and third segment needs to be, and checked if it was possible to divide the array into these groups, if it was possible, simple store the minimum for every iteration of i, j, k. answer in any iteration will be 2^i+2^j+2^k-n.</p> <p>Here is my code for the same  <submission link> </p> <<===>> 
<p>got the same idea as you!</p> <p>it's cool to solve it in $$$O(n + \log^4 n)$$$ instead of $$$O(n \log n)$$$</p> <p>can even solve in $$$O(n + \log^3 n)$$$ after some optimization</p> <p> <submission link> </p> <<===>>
