((-1, 907029)) <<===>> So, I have managed to create a test that hacks the hashes in the model solution for problem E. Now, my curiosity is: when hacking a solution, what does the checker use to find out what the correct answer to that given test is? Since if it would use the model solution, using a test like this, on which the model solution gives a wrong answer, could hack every solution, even the correct ones, and also make the problem impossible to solve if added to the testcases.

((907029, 907033)) <<===>> I've changed the model solution so that it is deterministic now, so the checker will compare the answer to the deterministic solution. Most likely the outcome will be something like "unexpected verdict" on hack since one of presumably correct solutions in Polygon is challenged. By the way, how do you hack the model solution? I thought this way of hashing subtrees worked well. [<<<new_com>>>]
((907033, 907036)) <<===>> What I have done is:  try random trees with n=5 until two give the same first hash (takes about 60k tries on average) try trees with n=11 constructed as follows: first 6 layers are all 'A', and each of the subtrees under the 7th layer is a random one between the 2 found in step 1, this guarantees that the first hash will still give the same value to all the trees generated like so. And try until two trees give the same second hash (about 60k tries as well). same as step 2, but this time with n=17, and the subtrees under the 7th layer being a random one out of the 2 found before, until two trees give the same third hash (also around 60k tries)  [<<<new_com>>>]
((907036, 907043)) <<===>> Do you mean that you've hacked the hashes with seed $$$42$$$? awoo always replaces generator seeds to $$$42$$$ when posting randomized solutions in editorials. You can try uphacking the solution, but most likely it won't work since the random generator seed in the actual solution is not $$$42$$$. Instead, it's time-dependent. [<<<new_com>>>]
((907043, 907045)) <<===>> oh, yeah, I have hacked the one with seed 42, it makes sense for the actual solution to be time dependent. [<<<new_com>>>]
