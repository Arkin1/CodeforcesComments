((-1, 909051)) <<===>> Can someone explain the part of editorial on problem D which says "you can insert 1 somewhere, then insert x somewhere. The rest of insertions will be free." Why will be the rest of the insertions be free?  [<<<new_com>>>]
((909051, 909056)) <<===>> If you have 1, x somewhere or x, 1 somewhere than you can insert arbitrarily any element between 1 to x in between them for 0 cost , I will discuss 1, x case you can do x, 1 similarly , Now suppose you insert 1<c<x between 1 and x , cost will be (x — c) + (c — 1) = x — 1, so it's free now we know if 2 are adjacent it holds true imagine there are some elements already in between 1 and x  1 C1 C2 x, it won't matter what order C1, C2 are in you can insert 1 < c < x between 1, C1 or C1, C2 or C2, x depending on which range it lies in, it will definitely be between more than one of the 3 ranges So cost of insertion will again be 0  [<<<new_com>>>]
