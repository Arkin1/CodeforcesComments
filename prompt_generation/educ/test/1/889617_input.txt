((-1, 889617)) <<===>> Here are two alternate solutions for F. (Neither one uses any prior knowledge about the Stirling numbers.) Simple no-FFT solutionAs in the main editorial, consider the related problem with only operations of type $$$G$$$. Applying several operations of type $$$G$$$ to an array is equivalent to applying some permutation to the codomain $$$\{1 \ldots k\}$$$ of the array. Since these operations are invertible, and we need to count equivalence classes with respect to this operation, it makes sense to try  (link to problem F)  [<<<new_com>>>]
