((948121, 948223)) => <div class="ttypography"><p>This is somewhat similar to the binary search solution. In it you change the smallest values such that all $$$a_i \ge \frac{ans}{2}$$$, and then cleverly choose which remaining values to change. Turns out that there are only two cases: zero values left or $$$\ge$$$ one value left, so in our greedy solution, we also leave one value to do something with, hence we change the $$$k - 1$$$ smallest values.</p></div>
