((-1, 889877)) <<===>> can anyone help in telling me what is wrong in my solution for Problem B  (link to problem B) . This solution is working on visual studio community and i have checked my times that it gives distinct anti-Fibonacci permutations only. but when submitted on codeforces online judge it shows "wrong answer on test 2".

((890136, 890178)) <<===>> thanks for reply.`` When i compile the program on visual studio with same input as shown by you, visual studio is showing different output. ![](https://disk.yandex.com/i/JFdst1Kg8uUVRw) link provided by you is showing two same permutations but visual studio is showing all distinct permutations.

((890178, 890179)) <<===>> It's because you are initializing the seed dynamically (based on current time). It's entirely possible that it produces one answer on your machine, another on mine, and a completely different one on Codeforces. Hence, you can't guarantee it to produce a correct solution.

((890179, 890188)) <<===>> thanks again . look at this submission  (link to problem Irrelevant)  in this i have removed seed but even then it is not accepting the answer. now it is showing that test case 7 is not anti-fib permutation. However this is not the case as one can easily verify that in case 7 program is printing anti-fib numbers only. [<<<new_com>>>]
((890188, 890195)) <<===>>  You removed the seed, but you did not remove the randomization (see the random_shuffle function). Hence, your program can still produce different answers based on the seed chosen during runtime. The error message does not mean that your program anti fibonacci permutation for $$$n = 7$$$. It means, that it prints an anti fibonacci permuation for some $$$n$$$ which is present in testcase 7. If you have any more doubts, you can simply use my website to get failing testcases for your submission. For example, your latest one fails on Ticket 636  [<<<new_com>>>]
