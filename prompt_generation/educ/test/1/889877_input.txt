((-1, 889877)) => <p>can anyone help in telling me what is wrong in my solution for Problem B  <submission link> . This solution is working on visual studio community and i have checked my times that it gives distinct anti-Fibonacci permutations only. but when submitted on codeforces online judge it shows "wrong answer on test 2". </p>
((889877, 890136)) => <p>Failing testcase: <a href="https://cfstress.com/status/633">Ticket 633</a></p>
((890136, 890178)) => <p>thanks for reply.`` When i compile the program on visual studio with same input as shown by you, visual studio is showing different output.</p> <p>![](<a href="https://disk.yandex.com/i/JFdst1Kg8uUVRw">https://disk.yandex.com/i/JFdst1Kg8uUVRw</a>)</p> <p>link provided by you is showing two same permutations but visual studio is showing all distinct permutations.</p>
((890178, 890179)) => <p>It's because you are initializing the seed dynamically (based on current time). It's entirely possible that it produces one answer on your machine, another on mine, and a completely different one on Codeforces. Hence, you can't guarantee it to produce a correct solution.</p>
((890179, 890188)) => <p>thanks again . look at this submission  <submission link>  in this i have removed seed but even then it is not accepting the answer. now it is showing that test case 7 is not anti-fib permutation. However this is not the case as one can easily verify that in case 7 program is printing anti-fib numbers only.</p>
((890188, 890195)) => <ol> <li><p>You removed the seed, but you did not remove the randomization (see the <strong>random_shuffle</strong> function). Hence, your program can still produce different answers based on the seed chosen during runtime.</p></li> <li><p>The error message does not mean that your program anti fibonacci permutation for $$$n = 7$$$. It means, that it prints an anti fibonacci permuation for some $$$n$$$ which is present in testcase 7.</p></li> <li><p>If you have any more doubts, you can simply use my website to get failing testcases for your submission. For example, your latest one fails on <a href="https://cfstress.com/status/636">Ticket 636</a></p></li> </ol>
