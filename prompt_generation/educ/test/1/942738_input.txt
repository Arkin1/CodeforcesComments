((-1, 942738)) => <div class="ttypography"><p>Where does the &quot;/6&quot; and &quot;/15&quot; come from at problem E1? I ve seen this on many solutions. </p><p>I guess its an optimization for finding all triplets i,j,k with a fixed k, but i dont undersand it.</p></div>
((942738, 942748)) => <div class="ttypography"><p>You will see, if(i==6 j==10 k==15), lcm(i,j,k)=30 &lt; i+j+k, if(i==3 j==4 k==6), lcm(i,j,k)=12 &lt; i+j+k, and you may enlarge i,j,k because if lcm(i,j,k) &lt; i+j+k ,then X(lcm(i,j,k)) &lt; X(i+j+k) ,since X is a positive integer.</p><p>And why is the cases (i==6 j==10 k==15) and (i==3 j==4 k==6) ? That's because 1/5+1/3+1/2 &gt; 1 and 1/4+1/3+1/2 &gt; 1</p></div>
((942738, 942755)) => <div class="ttypography"><p>This is for finding $$$(i, j, k)$$$ where $$$lcm(i,j,k)=2k$$$ and $$$i+j&gt;k$$$.</p><p>Note that because of the second condition, $$$\frac{k}{2} &lt; j &lt; k$$$. Since $$$j$$$ divides $$$2k$$$, $$$j$$$ must be $$$\frac{2k}{3}$$$.</p><p>Using the second condition again, $$$\frac{k}{3}&lt;i&lt;\frac{2k}{3}$$$, which implies $$$i$$$ is either $$$\frac{2k}{5}$$$ or $$$\frac{k}{2}$$$.</p><p>So the solution triplets in this case has the form $$$(\frac{2k}{5}, \frac{2k}{3}, k)$$$ (happens when $$$15$$$ divides $$$k$$$), or $$$(\frac{k}{2}, \frac{2k}{3}, k)$$$ (happens when $$$6$$$ divides $$$k$$$).</p></div>
