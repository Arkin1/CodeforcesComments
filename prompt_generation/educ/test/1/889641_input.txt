((-1, 889641)) <<===>> Can someone help me understand why we need the break condition in D? What are those cases requiring that break? [<<<new_com>>>]
((889641, 889654)) <<===>> Let's say after i'th query you get all rows (column can be anything) in the query. This would mean that whatever colours were present in all the cells before, are updated (possibly to the same colour but updated for sure) so any query that was processed before i'th query is no longer relevant to the final state. If however, we do process them in reverse order, it will update colour of some cell which shouldn't have been the case. Same goes for queries covering all columns instead of rows hence we have to check for both. [<<<new_com>>>]
((889641, 889658)) <<===>> Break condition is required when we have painted either all the rows or all the columns since after that final colour of a query would remain same.  RememberQueries are being processed backwards [<<<new_com>>>]
