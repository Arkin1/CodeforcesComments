((-1, 900174)) <<===>> Can someone please help me with this solution? I am not getting why this sol isn't working, it would be great if someone can suggest a test ( of reasonable length)case in which it fails . (link to problem C)  PS: I tried finding the array with the largest possible sum and its length (**let l **) and for all values of k <= l, I added k*x to the max sum and for all k > l, I checked for subarray of size k with the largest sum and printed max of ( prev_sum, (cur_sum + k*x)).
