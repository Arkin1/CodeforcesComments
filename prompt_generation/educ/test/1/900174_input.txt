<p>Can someone please help me with this solution? I am not getting why this sol isn't working, it would be great if someone can suggest a test ( of reasonable length)case in which it fails . <submission link> </p> <p><strong>PS:</strong> I tried finding the array with the largest possible sum and its length (**let l **) and for all values of k &lt;= l, I added k*x to the max sum and for all k &gt; l, I checked for subarray of size k with the largest sum and printed max of ( prev_sum, (cur_sum + k*x)). </p> <<===>> 
<p><strong>Failing testcase</strong>: <a href="https://cfstress.com/status/2989">Ticket 2989</a> </p> <<===>> 
<p>Thanks, got it finally .</p> <<===>>
