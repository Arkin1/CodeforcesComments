((-1, 893628)) => <p>As for problem F, I think the solution described in the tutorial is in $$$O(n\sqrt{n}\log n)$$$ time complexity, because we have $$$O(\sqrt{n})$$$ $$$\lceil\frac{n}{i}\rceil$$$ s, and calculating each of them takes $$$O(n\log n)$$$. But the solution of F says it takes $$$O(n\log^2n)$$$, am I wrong or the tutorial made a mistake? Can anyone help me?</p>
((893628, 894046)) => <p>The polynomial describing $$$A_i$$$ has $$$\min(i, k) + 1$$$ terms, so the complexity of calculating $$$A_i$$$ is $$$O(i \log i)$$$ and the total complexity is $$$\sum \limits_{i = 1}^n O(\frac n i \log \frac n i) = O(n \log^2 n)$$$.</p>
