((-1, 889499)) <<===>> Can anyone help why is this giving me TLE for D  (link to problem D)  ? [<<<new_com>>>]
((889499, 889537)) <<===>> You have initialized arrays visr and visc of size n and m respectively. Hence your time complexity is O(t*(n+m)) or larger, which in the worst case will be 2*1e9 since there is no limit on sum of m,n over all test cases. [<<<new_com>>>]
((889537, 889554)) <<===>> Thanks for the help I didn't noticed that. [<<<new_com>>>]
((889537, 896394)) <<===>> Woah! I was facing the same issue. I would've never figured this out without your comment. [<<<new_com>>>]
