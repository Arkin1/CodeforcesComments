<p>Can anyone help why is this giving me TLE for D  <submission link>  ?</p> <<===>> 
<p>You have initialized arrays visr and visc of size n and m respectively. Hence your time complexity is O(t*(n+m)) or larger, which in the worst case will be 2*1e9 since there is no limit on sum of m,n over all test cases.</p> <<===>> 
<p>Thanks for the help I didn't noticed that.</p> <<===>>
