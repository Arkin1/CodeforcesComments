((889499, 889537)) => <p>You have initialized arrays visr and visc of size n and m respectively. Hence your time complexity is O(t*(n+m)) or larger, which in the worst case will be 2*1e9 since there is no limit on sum of m,n over all test cases.</p>
((889537, 889554)) => <p>Thanks for the help I didn't noticed that.</p>
