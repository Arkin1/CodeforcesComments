I will be thankful to you!!</p><p><em>&quot;2. The diameter of the graph is equal to max1≤i≤n−1d(i,i+1)=min(max1≤i≤n−1min(ai,ai+1),2⋅min(a1…an)).</em> <em>Proof: since the minimum of a subsegment can only decrease when it's length increases, it is optimal to look only at the distance between two adjacent vertices.&quot;</em></p><p>What does it mean <strong>&quot; the minimum of a subsegment can only decrease when its length increases&quot;</strong> ? and how are we coming to an intuition where considering <strong>d(i,i+1)</strong> is an optimal choice</p></div>
