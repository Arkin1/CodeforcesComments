((-1, 889815)) <<===>> Apparently an O(n^2) solution is what is wanted by C... I guess I should have just went for it. I tried finding a solution where I was trying to basically mask the array and use those masks to find the respective points and values of the sums. Good problem overall, just didn't realize it could only be solved with O(n^2) and that was good enough. [<<<new_com>>>]
