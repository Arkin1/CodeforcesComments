((-1, 940329)) => <p>Problem C can also be solved in super ugly way using binary lifting and segment tree.</p>
((940329, 940347)) => <p>can you explain ur idea,Thank You.</p>
((940347, 940414)) => <p>First, let's normalize the array in such a way that the order of elements is $$$(0,0) =&gt; (1,0) =&gt; (2,0)...=&gt; (m-1,0) =&gt; (m-1, 1) =&gt; (m - 2, 1) =&gt; ... (0,1)$$$ (zero-indexed). Let this array be $$$a_{i}$$$ and let' call this way of ordering <strong>forward order</strong>. Similarly, let the reverse of $$$a_{i}$$$ be $$$b_{i}$$$ and let's call way of ordering be <strong>backward order</strong>. Let's consider the case when we enter the cell $$$(i,0)$$$ in time $$$t$$$ and til then we moved snakely(?). Then, what we want to compute is:</p>   <center>$$$ f_{i}(t) := \text {Total time taken to move from $$$a_{i}$$$ to $$$a_{2m-i-1}$$$ when we enter $$$a_{i}$$$ in time $$$t$$$} $$$</center> <p>Similarly, when we enter the cell $$$(i,1)$$$ in time $$$t$$$ then what we want to compute is:</p>   <center>$$$ g_{i}(t) := \text {Total time taken to move from $$$b_{i}$$$ to $$$b_{2m-i-1}$$$ when we enter $$$b_{i}$$$ in time $$$t$$$} $$$</center> <p>Now, these two cases are almost equivalent, so I'll ignore the latter case here. Let's call an element $$$a_{j}$$$ <strong>blocking</strong> to $$$a_{i}$$$ if we enter $$$a_{i}$$$ in time $$$a_{i}+1$$$ we cannot move to $$$a_{j}$$$ without being stuck (which means that we cannot enter $$$a_{j}$$$ without being stuck at $$$a_{j-1}$$$). Then it is obvious that $$$a_{j} \gt a_{i} + j - i$$$ must hold. We only need to consider blocking elements to $$$a_{i}$$$ because the total time taken to reach $$$a_{2m-i-1}$$$ from $$$a_{i}$$$ only depends on the last blocking element with position less than or equal to $$$2m-i-1$$$ (Let's call this position $$$p_{i}$$$). Now, it follows that:</p>   <center>$$$ f_{i}(a_{i}+1) = 2m - i - p_{i} + a_{p_{i}} $$$</center> <p>And if we let $$$q_{i}(t)$$$ be the first position of blocking element to $$$a_{i}$$$ when we enter $$$a_{i}$$$ in time $$$t$$$, then it also follows that:</p>   <center>$$$ f_{i}(t)=2m-i-p_{q_{i}(t)}+a_{p_{q_{i}(t)}} $$$</center> <p>Notice that if we store $$$a_{i}-i$$$ for each $$$i$$$ then $$$q_{i}(t)$$$ can easily be calculated using segment tree (we only need to find the first position $$$j (\gt i)$$$ such that $$$a_{j} - j \geq t - i$$$). Also, if we store position of $$$2^k$$$th blocking element to $$$a_{i}$$$ when we enter $$$a_{i}$$$ in time $$$a_{i}+1$$$ for each $$$i$$$ and $$$k$$$, $$$p_{i}$$$ can also be calculated easily using binary lifting. The formulas are quite ugly but I tried my best to explain my logic. </p>
