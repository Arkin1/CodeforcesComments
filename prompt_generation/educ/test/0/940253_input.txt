((-1, 940253)) <<===>> In problem $$$A$$$, can anybody explain solution using modulo. I don't want to deal with rounding. It's confusing for me. If $$$n$$$ $$$mod$$$ $$$3 = 0$$$ then answer is $$$\frac{n}{3}$$$, else if $$$n$$$ $$$mod$$$ $$$2 = 0$$$ then answer is $$$\frac{n}{2}$$$. But what in other cases ?  [<<<new_com>>>]
((940253, 940273)) <<===>> If $$$n \bmod 3 = 0$$$, then the answer is $$$\frac{n}{3}$$$. If $$$n \bmod 3 = 1$$$, then there are two cases. For $$$n = 1$$$ (the only special case), the answer is $$$2$$$. Otherwise, the answer is $$$\frac{n - 4}{3} + 2$$$. Since we excluded the special case of $$$n = 1$$$, the value of $$$n$$$ must be at least $$$4$$$, and $$$n - 4$$$ must be divisible by $$$3$$$. So we can keep taking $$$3$$$-length steps until we have $$$4$$$ left, which we can cover with two $$$2$$$-length steps. If $$$n \bmod 3 = 2$$$, then the answer is $$$\frac{n - 2}{3} + 1$$$. Keep taking $$$3$$$-length steps until you have $$$2$$$ left, which you cover with a single $$$2$$$-length step.  Note that your suggestion of using $$$\frac{n}{2}$$$ for $$$n \bmod 2 = 0$$$ is not necessarily optimal, e.g., you can reach $$$8$$$ using $$$3 + 3 + 2$$$, which is 3 steps instead of $$$\frac{8}{2} = 4$$$.
