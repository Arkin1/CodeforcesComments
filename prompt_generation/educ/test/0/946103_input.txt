((946103, 946112)) => <div class="ttypography"><p>Your solution has complexity $$$O(n + \dfrac{s}{k-1})$$$ where $$$\dfrac{s}{k-1}$$$ could also be $$$10^{18}$$$. <br /><br /> The complexity would then be $$$O(10^{18})$$$. Even worse, it could be that for all 1000 tests, bringing the complexity up to $$$O(10^{21})$$$.<br /><br /> The solution proposed in the editorial has complexity $$$O(2*n)$$$, which, in the worst case, is $$$O(2*10^5)$$$. Now, if you &quot;translate&quot; your solution (in worst case scenario) to be based upon paramater $$$n$$$ ( $$$n$$$ in the worst case), it would be $$$O(n^3)$$$ in the single test-case and $$$O(n^4)$$$ if $$$t = 1000$$$.</p></div>
