((-1, 940237)) <<===>> Would any kind-hearted person mind explaining to me why "the sum of F^k over all possible combinations is equal to the sum of G(t) over all possible tuples t"? I am not able to figure out why they are equal, what is the intuition behind and how could we prove it (the rest is straightforward tho, just can't comprehend the rephrased problem) [<<<new_com>>>]
((940237, 940252)) <<===>> In essence, the problem asks for you to get the sum of F^k for all combination of ball selection. However, if you look at a specific selection with F odd numbers, the number of tuples of length k, where each element is an index of a bag from which we have taken an odd ball is exactly F^k.  So in order to get the sum of all F^k, we can just look at each possible tuple, and look how many times this tuple appear across all ball selection, which is the definition of G(t). [<<<new_com>>>]
