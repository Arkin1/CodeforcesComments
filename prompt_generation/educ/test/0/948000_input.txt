((-1, 948000)) <<===>> For problems like C, I found it's incredibly time-consuming for me to get every +1/-1/0 right, like the indices starting from 0/1, the number of steps required starting from the first cell/before the first cell. Does anybody have suggestions for dealing with this? [<<<new_com>>>]
