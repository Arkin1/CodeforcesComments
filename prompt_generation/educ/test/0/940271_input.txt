((-1, 940271)) => <p>With how unusually long the editorial for C is, I'm surprised that the problem-setters still felt it was appropriate to keep it as a Div2C. </p> <p>For D, the editorial should probably mention how we need to keep track of the first non-zero value in each row (variable $$$mn$$$ in the solution) and only start filling it up from there, since it seems like starting from the beginning resulted in many TLEs. </p>
((940271, 940395)) => <p>I think I maybe overexplained things for C. A lot of people got stuck in it, so I decided it's reasonable to explain just everything in the problem as thoroughly as possible.</p> <p>Really, I think half of these things are pretty intuitive and the other half is neither that hard to come up with, nor is the only way to come to the solution.</p>
((940271, 940819)) => <p>No, keeping first non-zero element is not necessary. I didn't do that, and had not big time.</p>
