Hello ChatGPT. I want you remember all your knowledge in competitive programming and help me label a couple of things. 

I will give you a comment tree from Codeforces from a specific blog round. I want you to label each comment based on the following labels SolutionExp, HintExp, AlgoExp, TimeComExp, FixingExp, TestExp, QuestionExp, SubQuestion, TestQuestion, Irrelevant. A short description of the labels can be seen below :

SolutionExp  -  A comment which explains in detail how to solve a problem, more like a step by step guide. 
HintExp   -  It can be viewed as a sparse variant of SolutionExp in which just various elements from an entire solution are presented. 
AlgoExp   -  A comment which states the algorithm used and the submission link with little to no information. 
TimeComExp  - A comment which states the time complexity and the submission link with little to no information.
FixingExp   - A comment which explains or gives a hint in how to solve a specific bug in an implementation
TestExp    - A comment which explains the result of an output test for a given problem. 
QuestionExp   -  A relevant question about a specific problem in the contest.
SubQuestion  -  A comment which asks insights about why a submission fails. 
TestQuestion  -  A comment which asks insights about the result of a specific input test. 
Irrelevant   -  Any other comment which doesn't fit in the labels defined above.  

A comment will have the following structure:
(the father id of the comment or -1 if doesnt exist, comment id) <<===>> text.


I will provide you with some correctly labelled example.

For example:
(-1, 22331) <<===>> I really loved this round!.[<<<new_com>>>]
(22331, 22334) <<===>> Yeah it was pretty cool especially problem C which can be solved  with binary search. (link to problem C).[<<<new_com>>>]
(22334, 22335) <<===>> Here is how I solved problem C. The problem gives as multiple queries and an array. Each query asks us to see if an element is in
the array or not. To solve the problem, I sorted the array in ascending order using merge sort and for each query I used binary search to find
if the element is in array or not. Total complexity is $$$N*log(N) + Q*log(N)$$$. Here is my submission: (link to problem C)[<<<new_com>>>]
(22335, 22339) <<===>> There is no need to solve the problem using sorting and binary search, a hash can suffice.[<<<new_com>>>]
(22339, 22340) <<===>> I solved the problem in O(n). Here is my submission (link to problem C)[<<<new_com>>>]
(-1, 22350) <<===>> How to solve problem D??[<<<new_com>>>]
(-1, 22351) <<===>> Can somebody tell me why I am getting wrong answer on preset 3, here is my submission (link to problem B)[<<<new_com>>>]
(22351, 22352) <<===>> You should do floating division and not integer division.[<<<new_com>>>]
(-1, 22355) <<===>> Why the result in the first test case is 1 and not 3?[<<<new_com>>>]
(22355, 22356) <<===>> In the statement it says that odd numbers should be counted.[<<<new_com>>>]

You should label it like this

(-1, 22331) <<===>> Irrelevant[<<<new_com>>>]
(22331, 22334) <<===>> AlgoExp[<<<new_com>>>]
(22334, 22335) <<===>> SolutionExp[<<<new_com>>>]
(22335, 22339) <<===>> HintExp[<<<new_com>>>]
(22339, 22340) <<===>> TimeComExp[<<<new_com>>>]
(-1, 22350) <<===>> QuestionExp[<<<new_com>>>]
(-1, 22351) <<===>> SubQuestion[<<<new_com>>>]
(22351, 22352) <<===>> FixingExp[<<<new_com>>>]
(-1, 22355) <<===>> TestQuestion[<<<new_com>>>]
(22355, 22356) <<===>> TestExp[<<<new_com>>>]

Please encode the previous explanation of the labelling in a variable named %rule%. Whenever I use %rule% in a text, you should follow the exact rules I specified
above. Please respond with the correct label and don't forget to keep printing comment id and father id as above, especially if there is just one comment in a tree.
