Applying several operations of type $$$G$$$ to an array is equivalent to applying some permutation to the codomain $$$\\{1 \\ldots k\\}$$$ of the array. Since these operations are invertible, and we need to count equivalence classes with respect to this operation, it makes sense to try <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Burnside%27s_lemma\">Burnside's lemma<\/a>. That gives an explicit formula:<\/p> <center>$$$ \\displaystyle A_n = \\frac{1}{k!} \\sum_{\\sigma \\in S_k} \\bigg|\\{a \\in (\\{1 \\ldots n\\} \\to \\{1 \\ldots k\\}) : a = \\sigma \\circ a\\}\\bigg| $$$<\/center><p>For a given permutation $$$\\sigma \\in S_k$$$, we have that $$$a = \\sigma \\circ a$$$ if and only if $$$a$$$ maps $$$\\{1 \\ldots n\\}$$$ into the set of fixed points of $$$\\sigma$$$. So the formula can be simplified to<\/p> <center>$$$ \\displaystyle A_n = \\frac{1}{k!} \\sum_{i=0}^k \\bigg|\\{\\sigma \\in S_k : \\left|\\{j \\in \\{1 \\ldots k\\} : j = \\sigma(j)\\}\\right| = i\\}\\bigg| \\cdot i^n. $$$<\/center><p>Each permutation on $$$\\{1 \\ldots k\\}$$$ with exactly $$$i$$$ fixed points is uniquely determined by the set of its fixed points, and by the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Derangement\">derangement<\/a> (no-fixpoint-permutation) it induces on the other $$$k - i$$$ points in its domain. So, the formula further reduces to<\/p> <center>$$$ \\displaystyle A_n = \\frac{1}{k!} \\sum_{i=0}^k \\binom{k}{i} \\cdot D_{k-i} \\cdot i^n. $$$<\/center><p>Counting derangements is easy and well-known, so this formula allows direct calculation of $$$A_i$$$ in $$$O(k \\log{i})$$$. But since it is impossible to use more than $$$i$$$ different values in an array of length $$$i$$$, this can be reduced to $$$O(i \\log{i})$$$ by just replacing $$$k$$$ with $$$\\min(i, k)$$$.<\/p><p>The solution to the original problem in terms of $$$A_i$$$ is the same as described in the main editorial.<\/p><p>Implementation: <a href=\"\/contest\/1644\/submission\/147499995\" title=\"Submission 147499995 by clyring\">147499995<\/a><\/p><\/div><\/div>   <div class=\"spoiler\"><b class=\"spoiler-title\">EGF+ODE solution<\/b><div class=\"spoiler-content\" style=\"display: none;\"><p>The editorial describes how to solve the problem in terms of $$$\\sum_{j=0}^k S(i, j)$$$ for various values of $$$i$$$. This is another way to compute only that quantity.<\/p><p>Let $$$g_j(t) = \\sum_{i=0}^\\infty S(i, j) \\frac{t^i}{i!}$$$ as a formal power series. It is the EGF of the $$$j$$$-th column of the Stirling numbers. Since multiplication of EGFs corresponds to partitioning, it can be seen that $$$g_j(t) = \\frac{(g_1(t))^j}{j!}$$$: The $$$j!$$$ in the denominator forgets the order in which the sets were used in the partition. It's also easy to see that $$$g_1(t) = e^t - 1$$$.<\/p><p>To solve the problem, we need to calculate $$$\\sum_{j=0}^k S(i, j)$$$ for various values of $$$i$$$. So, we can consider the function $$$h(t) = \\sum_{j=0}^k g_j(t) = \\sum_{j=0}^k \\frac{(g_1(t))^j}{j!}$$$ and calculate its coefficients. There is obviously not enough time to evaluate all terms of this sum; we will have to cancel most of them out and then undo this. One way to achieve this by noticing that $$$h(t)$$$ is almost the same as $$$\\exp{(g_1(t))}$$$. So, $$$h$$$ satisfies $$$h'(t) \\approx h(t) \\cdot g_1'(t)$$$. We can calculate the exact value easily and then solve the resulting ODE as follows:<\/p> <div class=\"spoiler\"><b class=\"spoiler-title\">Spoiler<\/b><div class=\"spoiler-content\" style=\"display: none;\"><center>$$$ \\begin{array}{rl} h'(t) &amp; \\displaystyle = \\sum_{j=0}^k j \\cdot \\frac{(g_1(t))^{j-1} \\cdot g_1'(t)}{j!} \\\\ &amp; \\displaystyle = g_1'(t) \\cdot \\sum_{j=0}^{k-1} \\frac{(g_1(t))^j}{j!} \\\\ &amp; \\displaystyle = g_1'(t) \\cdot \\left(h(t) - \\frac{(g_1(t))^k}{k!}\\right) \\\\<br\/><br\/>\\displaystyle h'(t) - g_1'(t) \\cdot h(t) &amp; \\displaystyle = - \\frac{d}{dt} \\frac{(g_1(t))^{k+1}}{(k+1)!} \\\\<br\/><br\/>\\displaystyle e^{-g_1(t)} \\cdot (h'(t) - g_1'(t) \\cdot h(t)) &amp; \\displaystyle = - e^{-g_1(t)} \\cdot \\frac{d}{dt} \\frac{(g_1(t))^{k+1}}{(k+1)!} \\\\<br\/><br\/>\\displaystyle e^{-g_1(t)} \\cdot h(t) &amp; = \\displaystyle e^{-g_1(0)} \\cdot h(0) - \\int_{s = 0}^t e^{-g_1(s)} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{d}{ds} \\frac{(g_1(s))^{k+1}}{(k+1)!}\\right) ds \\\\<br\/><br\/>\\displaystyle h(t) &amp; = \\displaystyle e^{g_1(t)} \\cdot \\left( 1 - \\int_{s = 0}^t e^{-g_1(s)} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{d}{ds} \\frac{(g_1(s))^{k+1}}{(k+1)!}\\right) ds \\right)<br\/><br\/>\\end{array} $$$<\/center><\/div><\/div><p>This formula can be directly implemented in $$$O(n \\log n)$$$, at least if you have access to a library\/template for the necessary formal power series\/generating function operations.

Now, key insight. You can find out whether edge is selected in MST in other way: join everything (literally everything) up to edge w with weight less than it, and calculate number of components (it's not a tree anymore). Edge will be selected in MST if and only if number of components decrease with this additional edge.<\/p> <p>Now, consider what we have to join for some q. We have to join everything from w to q + (q \u2014 w). Because only those weights satisfy |weight \u2014 q| &lt; w, where w is our edge for which we prove this fact. And when we increase q then left 'side' of subrange is fixed and only right side of 'subrange' is increasing. So we only add new edges into our 'join everything' graph. So edge with weight w will be selected while it decrease number of components. In other words, it will not be selected when vertices it connects ends up within same component. Case when q &lt; w is completely symmetrical.<\/p> <p>Looks legit.<\/p> <p>From now on: for q &gt; w edge is used for single range, and for q &lt; w edge is used for single range. But it's easy to see that for q = w we use edge with weight w. Possible loophole: what if several edges has same weight and same endpoints, you can't use all of them, you'll use only one of them. But I think it can be proven if done more carefully.<\/p>","comment_rating":5,"timestamp":1643760000000,"problem":"E","label":"HintExp","round_id":"\/contest\/1633","round_name":"Educational Codeforces Round 122 (Rated for Div. 2)"},"https:\/\/codeforces.com\/blog\/entry\/99539?#comment-883210":{"id":883210,"father_id":-1,"username":"\/profile\/Shady.ELharakly","text":"<p>it was very good contest but weak testcases in C was bad point in it <\/p>","comment_rating":27,"timestamp":1643673600000,"problem":"C","label":"Irrelevant","round_id":"\/contest\/1633","round_name":"Educational Codeforces Round 122 (Rated for Div. 2)"},"https:\/\/codeforces.com\/blog\/entry\/99539?#comment-883223":{"id":883223,"father_id":-1,"username":"\/profile\/notlikeduck","text":"<p>Out of curiosity, what was the purpose of having both explicit and compressed queries in problem E?

What we try to do here is: - 1 find all spots\/intervals where the MST (minimum spanning tree) changes - 2 add also all weights to this intervals (as you commented) to be sure that for a given interval any edge always increases or decreases its weight. For 1 you could go for (w_i + w_j) \/ 2 for all pair of weights (the spots where two different edges changes its order) but this will generate O(m^2) and most of these spots don't change the MST. So imagine that after you calculated all (w_i + w_j) \/ 2 you have a list like this intervals=[0, 6, 10, 16... , 120, 200]. You could calculate mst[interval[0]], mst[interval[end]]. - If those 2 mst are the same then all the other intervals could be eliminated, and also mst[end] (We are sure that the MST don't change in this range). - If they are different you calculate mid=mst[interval[(ini-end)\/2]] and recursive apply the same to [0,mid], [mid,end] In the end you should have something like O(m) intervals, so you did this binary search m times giving you a complexity of O(mlogm). Then you should add (2) all the edges. I hope this was a little more clearer than my previous explanation.

So if for the ith monster , lets say that it can be defeated by continuing to add 1 to the spell casted at the <code>i-1<\/code>th index until we reach the ith monster , so i directly do that , if i can defeat the current monster by starting from <code>1<\/code> again in between the time of the previous monster and the current , while pushing the index of the current element in the stack.

We cut off all white branches. Later we will need some of them, so we need to have e.g. either 1) a copy of an initial graph, or 2) save these white branches to a new graph, which is more efficient way, or 3) we can color branches instead of cutting. Additionally we need to save a node to which a particular cut branch is adjacent. But if a branch is adjacent to a black node we also can drop it, because we have an obvious answer: from all nodes of that branch we can move to the black node. Cutting a white branch is simple loop: we remove white leafs until there are no white leafs left.<\/p><p>The remaining graph has all of its leafs black.<\/p><p>2 . Now we can check if there are any three black nodes on the same way. If so then we can move to black node from any point of the graph. If not then we need to process further.

Answer is 'all 1', because that leaf attracts to itself from any of 2+ branches with the help of another branch.<\/p><p>3 . If we haven't obtained an answer 'all 1', then our graph can be seen as this:<\/p> <pre><code>[k_1,1]    [k_2,2]      [k_m,m]\n   |          |    ...    |\n(k_1-1,1) (k_2-1,2)   (k_m-1,m)\n   |          |    ...    |\n   :          :           :\n   |          |    ...    |\n (1,1)      (1,2)       (1,m)\n   |          |    ...    |\n  &lt;       white tree       &gt;\n<\/code><\/pre><p>where square brackets mark black nodes, parentheses mark white nodes, $$$m$$$ is a number of black leafs, and all $$$k_i \\ge 2$$$.<\/p><p>We can see that it is possible to move to black nodes only from the adjacent nodes: $$$(k_i-1,i), i = 1 \\dots m$$$.

Now we check for all nodes with zero answer if it is adjacent to previously cut branch (step 1). If so then all that branch has also zero answer.

Use a <code>map&lt;int, int&gt; m<\/code>, where values are hashes of a substring of $$$S$$$, and the corresponding value is the maximal number $$$i$$$ such that the length $$$i$$$ prefix and suffix of $$$S$$$ are the same. To calculate this, we iterate $$$i$$$ independently of the substring, and check if the prefix and suffix have the same hashes in $$$O(1)$$$ time. If so, we add update <code>m<\/code> on substrings $$$S[i+1..i+1+j]$$$ (technically their hash values). As we'll see later, we only care about $$$j \\leq 10$$$, so this takes $$$O(|S|\\log |S|)$$$ time which is fast enough (we can use an <code>unordered_map<\/code> or <code>gp_hash_table<\/code> as well but time is not an issue). Note that if we double-check our hash equality by directly comparing the substrings, we TLE on TC 36 which is all a's, since comparing strings\/generating substrings is linear in the length of the string so our program runs in $$$O(|s|^2)$$$ in that case.<\/p> <p>We consider every $$$|S|+i$$$ more or less independently (I will use uppercase letters). Let $$$T_i=T[1..i]$$$ denote the length $$$i$$$ prefix of $$$T$$$. Suppose we have some prefix string $$$x$$$ of $$$S+T_i$$$ that's also a suffix string. There are three possibilities:<\/p> <p>(1): Both the prefix and suffix strings lie in both $$$S$$$ and $$$T_i$$$. In this case, we can break $$$x$$$ up into $$$x_1,x_2,x_3$$$ (in that order) defined as follows: $$$x_1$$$ is the portion of the suffix string lying in $$$S$$$, $$$x_3$$$ is the portion of the prefix string lying in $$$T_i$$$, and $$$x_2$$$ is the remainder of $$$x$$$. To check if any $$$x$$$ of this type work, we iterate over $$$|x_3|:=j$$$, checking if the length-$$$j$$$ prefix and suffix of $$$T_i$$$ are the same. If so, then $$$x$$$ works if and only if the rightmost occurrence of $$$x_2$$$ in $$$S$$$ is as far right as it can be (i.e. occupies starting position $$$|S|-|x_2|$$$). In this case, the length-$$$|x_1|$$$ suffix of $$$S$$$ is also $$$x_1$$$, so we can use our precomputed <code>m<\/code>. There are at most $$$10$$$ values for $$$|x_3|$$$, so iterating over them is fast.<\/p> <p>(2): The prefix string lies entirely in $$$S$$$, but the suffix string does not lie entirely in $$$T_i$$$. This is more or less a simpler version of (1). We split $$$x$$$ into $$$x_1,x_2$$$ such that $$$x_2$$$ is the portion of the suffix string lying in $$$T_i$$$, and $$$x_1$$$ is the remainder. Since $$$x_2$$$ must be $$$T_i$$$ by definition, $$$T_i$$$ must appear in $$$S$$$ as a substring. Further, $$$x_1$$$ must also be the suffix string of $$$S$$$ when this happens. We can use <code>m<\/code> for this as well. Note that there's only one possible value for $$$x_2$$$.<\/p> <p>(3): The suffix string lies entirely in $$$T_i$$$. If $$$|S|\\geq i$$$, then that means the prefix string lies entirely in $$$S$$$. There's at most $$$10$$$ values for $$$x$$$, so we can iterate $$$j$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$i$$$ (inclusive) and check if $$$S[1..j]=T_i[i-j+1...i]$$$. Otherwise, we have to join $$$S$$$ and $$$T_i$$$, since the prefix string could partially lie in $$$T_i$$$ as well, but the actual check is the same. Since this case only occurs when $$$|S|\\leq 10$$$, joining $$$S$$$ and $$$T_i$$$ is quick (if you join $$$S$$$ and $$$T_i$$$ no matter what, you should TLE). Either way, you iterate through at most $$$10$$$ possible values for $$$x$$$. Ignore the comment at the top lol<\/p> <p>To find the final answer, we iterate through all $$$O(1)$$$ cases and update our maximum value each time. The final time complexity should be $$$O((|s|+q)\\log |s|)$$$ which works if you're not being stupid.<\/p>","comment_rating":0,"timestamp":1661731200000,"problem":"E","label":"SolutionExp","round_id":"\/contest\/1721","round_name":"Educational Codeforces Round 134 (Rated for Div. 2)"},"https:\/\/codeforces.com\/blog\/entry\/106416?#comment-948742":{"id":948742,"father_id":947925,"username":"\/profile\/nonrice","text":"<p>hello the hazard<\/p>","comment_rating":0,"timestamp":1661990400000,"problem":"Irrelevant","label":"Irrelevant","round_id":"\/contest\/1721","round_name":"Educational Codeforces Round 134 (Rated for Div. 2)"},"https:\/\/codeforces.com\/blog\/entry\/106416?#comment-947927":{"id":947927,"father_id":-1,"username":"\/profile\/lbm364dl","text":"<p>Why does F have to be online?

The basic idea is that the longest prefix of s+t matching some suffix of s+t will either have length (1) &gt;|t| or (2) &lt;=|t| . For the &gt;|t| part, some (proper)suffix of s will match some suffix of s i.e the z value(wrt the z algorithm) of the index i from which the suffix starts will be n-i (0-indexing assumed). For the &lt;=|t| part we can just brute force to obtain the answer in O(|t|^2) (to obtain prefix function values of s+t for its last |t| characters). So I first precomputed the z values of string s and then wherever z[i] was n-i, I considered all substrings, {(i+1,i+1),(i+1,i+2)...(i+max(|t|),max(n-1,i+10)) and update the 'score' values of each of these substrings. (score value of a string s1 being the prefix function value of s+s1 at the last index, considering only the case when the prefix length is larger than |s1|.) This can be done in O(max(|t|)) per i using a trie structure. Now while processing the queries, I first computed the prefix functions for case (2) as listed above using brute force in O(|t|^2) and for case(1), I just used the score values calculated for all the prefixes of t and updated the prefix function array (by taking max of answers obtained in both cases for each index). This can also in total be done in O(|t|^2) using the trie structure mentioned above. Hence the total complexity of the solution must be O(n.max(|t|)+q.(max(|t|)^2) ~ 2e7 operations which should comfortably pass in 2 seconds, however it TLEs.

But we find it not very easy to add the number of type 3 triples instantly. So it's necessary to maintain 'if we add\/delete point $$$x$$$ from the set, the number of $$$x$$$-as-the-middle triples being added\/deleted' in some way.<\/p> <p>Let's discuss how many triples will turn invalid when we <em>remove<\/em> a point from the set. One may notice that if we're <em>adding<\/em> $$$x$$$ to the set $$$S$$$, then for each $$$y \\in S, y \\in (x-d, x)$$$, for every point $$$z$$$ satisfying $$$z \\in [x-d, y), z \\in S$$$, $$$(z, y, x)$$$ will be a new beautiful triple in which $$$y$$$ sandwiching in between $$$x, z$$$. Let $$$c_y$$$ be the number of such $$$z$$$'s for each $$$y$$$. Obviously if we consider all valid $$$y$$$'s in increasing order (denoting $$$x-d&lt;y_1&lt;y_2&lt;\\cdots&lt;y_k&lt;x$$$), then $$$c_{y_i}=i-1$$$. It's similar for $$$y \\in (x, x+d)$$$. Thus we may maintain set $$$S$$$ with a binary search tree, and add arithmetic progressions on a specific segment \u2014 which is a classic trick \u2014 when adding an element to $$$S$$$. Once we want to remove a point $$$x$$$ from the set, substract the number of first 2 types along with the count of type 3 triples from the answer, which we've stored on the BST. Also, its deletion will lead to a negative contribution of $$$c_{y_i}$$$ for all valid $$$y$$$'s mentioned above, so don't forget to add the opposite number of a progression on the BST maintaining $$$S$$$.<\/p> <p>The next part is considering 'if $$$x$$$ is not in the set, how many $$$x$$$-in-the-middle triples will turn valid after <em>adding<\/em> it'. Suppose we're adding $$$x$$$ to the set $$$S$$$. We still consider $$$x-d&lt;y_1&lt;y_2&lt;\\cdots&lt;x$$$; then for each $$$i \\in \\lbrace{1,2,\\cdots,k-1}\\rbrace$$$, for all $$$z \\in (y_i,y_{i+1})$$$, $$$(y_j,z,x), j \\in \\lbrace{1,2,\\cdots,i}\\rbrace$$$ will be new beautiful $$$z$$$-in-the-middle triples <em>if $$$z$$$ is added after $$$x$$$<\/em>. It's obvious that for all $$$z$$$ in the same segment whose endpoints are adjacent $$$y$$$'s, the numbers of potential new valid triples are the same. Similarly, for each segment, the sequence of new potential valid triples is an arithmetic progression of common difference $$$1$$$. Thus we may use another BST to maintain all segments $$$(l,r), l\\in S, r\\in S, \\nexists p \\in S, p \\in (l,r)$$$ and proceed the sum of progressions. If we want to add $$$x$$$ to set $$$S$$$, then add the sum of contributions of type 1 &amp; 2 triples and the segment's to the answer, <em>split<\/em> the segment it belongs to to two (empty segments <em>should be preserved<\/em>), and do operations above.<\/p> <p>When removing $$$x$$$ from $$$S$$$, we may first add the opposite number of contributions of $$$x$$$ on two BST. What about <em>merging<\/em> two segments on the second BST? Do they have the same potential new triples after $$$x$$$ is deleted? The answer is YES. Apparently, for $$$x,y$$$ in segment $$$(l, r)$$$, if $$$(p, x, q), p\\leq l, q \\geq r$$$ is a valid potential triple, so does $$$(p, y, q)$$$ and vice versa.

When $$$i &gt; 1$$$, all numbers in the $$$i$$$-th row from the bottom is $$$\\frac{1}{i} - \\frac{1}{(i-1)}$$$. For every square that touches the bottom edge, the sum of numbers inside that square must be $$$1$$$. This is because the sum of any square of length $$$n$$$ must be $$$((\\frac{1}{n} - \\frac{1}{(n-1)}) + (\\frac{1}{(n-1)} - \\frac{1}{(n-2)}) \\ldots ) \\times n = 1$$$. This means that if we draw $$$k$$$ squares to partition and cover the bottom edge, the sum of all numbers inside these squares must be $$$k$$$. Notice that the sum of areas of these squares will correspond to $$$f(x, k)$$$. We define the \"optimal canonical partition\" of $$$f(x, k)$$$ as the one which is obtained by removing the numbers starting from the top row and from the leftmost column. It is easy to see that we will visit the optimal canonical partition of $$$f(x, 1)$$$, $$$f(x, 2)$$$, $$$\\ldots$$$, $$$f(x, x)$$$ in this order. In particular, $$$f(x, k)$$$ is visited when the sum of all remaining numbers is equal to $$$k$$$. The value of $$$f(x, k) - f(x, k + 1)$$$ is the number of numbers we are removing to obtain the optimal canonical partition of $$$f(x, k + 1)$$$ starting from the optimal canonical partition of $$$f(x, k)$$$. As the numbers we are removing are non-increasing, the number of numbers we are removing between each consecutive optimal canonical partition can only decrease. This proves that $$$f(x, k) - f(x, k + 1) \\ge f(x, k + 1) - f(x, k + 2)$$$ as desired. <\/p> <p><img alt=\" \" src=\"\/predownloaded\/fb\/6f\/fb6f6f1bc77fb9bf96e9844b8a37d70d1131e9cb.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"\/><\/p>","comment_rating":64,"timestamp":1649548800000,"problem":"F","label":"HintExp","round_id":"\/contest\/1661","round_name":"Educational Codeforces Round 126 (Rated for Div. 2)"},"https:\/\/codeforces.com\/blog\/entry\/101790?#comment-903342":{"id":903342,"father_id":903251,"username":"\/profile\/VaibhavAgarwala","text":"<p>How would you have time to learn English you have 5.9k problems solved on Codeforces bro<\/p>","comment_rating":-23,"timestamp":1649635200000,"problem":"Irrelevant","label":"Irrelevant","round_id":"\/contest\/1661","round_name":"Educational Codeforces Round 126 (Rated for Div. 2)"},"https:\/\/codeforces.com\/blog\/entry\/101790?#comment-903348":{"id":903348,"father_id":903342,"username":"\/profile\/CDUT_LYJ","text":"<p>bro ,he is too stranger<\/p>","comment_rating":-23,"timestamp":1649635200000,"problem":"Irrelevant","label":"Irrelevant","round_id":"\/contest\/1661","round_name":"Educational Codeforces Round 126 (Rated for Div. 2)"},"https:\/\/codeforces.com\/blog\/entry\/101790?#comment-903475":{"id":903475,"father_id":903251,"username":"\/profile\/jiangly","text":"<p>I have a proof for a generalized version of this problem, where you can only choose points in a given set of coordinates instead of all integers.

In case you don't know about difference array, you can read about it <a href=\"https:\/\/www.geeksforgeeks.org\/difference-array-range-update-query-o1\/\">here<\/a>. Basically, in a difference array (say $$$diff$$$) of an array $$$a$$$, $$$diff_i$$$ = $$$a_i-a_{i-1} \\forall i&gt;0$$$ and $$$diff_0 = a_0$$$. Reporting any value $$$a_i$$$ through the difference array can be done by calculating the prefix sum till $$$i$$$, i.e. $$$diff_0+diff_1+..+diff_i$$$. It is a useful tool for range queries. For example, for adding $$$x$$$ to every element of $$$a$$$ from $$$i$$$ to $$$j$$$ using a difference array, just add $$$x$$$ to $$$diff_i$$$ and subtract $$$x$$$ from $$$diff_{j+1}$$$ and the job is done. Also, adding $$$1$$$ to $$$a_i,$$$ $$$2$$$ to $$$a_{i+1}....k$$$ to $$$a_{i+k-1}$$$ is equivalent to adding $$$1$$$ to all of $$$diff_i,\u2026,diff_{i+k-1}$$$ and subtracting $$$k$$$ from $$$diff_{i+k}$$$, and this is exactly what we\u2019ll be using in this problem.<\/p> <p>Similar to the editorial, we will be iterating from right to left, from $$$i = n-1$$$ to $$$i=k$$$, and for every $$$i$$$, we will make $$$a_i \\geq b_i$$$ by adding progressions that end at $$$i$$$ (these are the most optimal progressions to add for increasing $$$a_i$$$ as they add $$$k$$$ to $$$a_i$$$). We calculate $$$a_i$$$ at the beginning of each iteration using prefix sum over the difference array, by range sum query (segment tree). Then, we calculate $$$need$$$ (same as editorial), $$$need = \\left\\lceil \\frac{b_i-a_i}{k} \\right\\rceil$$$. Now, we have to add $$$need$$$ progressions from $$$i-k+1$$$ to $$$i$$$, which is equivalent to adding $$$need$$$ to every element from $$$diff_{i-k+1}..diff_i$$$ and subtracting $$$need \\cdot k$$$ from $$$diff_{i+1}$$$. We do this range update using lazy propagation.<\/p> <p>Finally, we\u2019ll only be left with elements $$$0$$$ to $$$k-1$$$ and dealing with them is fairly simple, for these leftmost elements, the $$$i$$$ th element can only increase by $$$i+1$$$ in one progression, so we just find $$$max_{0\\leq i\\leq k-1} \\left\\lceil \\frac{b_i-a_i}{i+1} \\right\\rceil$$$, i.e. the max $$$need$$$ for the first $$$k$$$ elements and add it to the answer.<\/p> <p>You can look at my submission <a href=\"\/contest\/1661\/submission\/153552061\" title=\"Submission 153552061 by yellow_13\">153552061<\/a> for the implementation.

Now, for each tree we need to remove moves with sum 2. For each tree do the following: if there is +2 move then remove it, otherwise all moves are +1 so there are at least 2 of those, and we can remove 2. The last move we do is either +2 or +1 so if we remove last one -&gt; we got better time. The idea is to ensure we remove both: move +2 and move +1 to decrease the time for sure. This brings two bad cases:<\/p> <ul> <li>the case where we only remove +2<\/li> <li>the case where we only remove +1<\/li> <\/ul><p>Details:<\/p> <ul> <li><p>If we only removed +1 this means there is no +2 at all, but this means we have at least n * 2 of +1 moves (because h + 2 &gt;= max + 2), and because n &gt;= 2 this means we have at least 4 of +1 moves. Then for at least one tree we can replace two +1 into one +2 and the time will be better, so it wasn't optimal in the first place. (time of last +1 is decreased, and appearance of +2 could only set time to 2, but this to be the case you have to leave with one or zero of +1 moves, and this is impossible.)<\/p><\/li> <li><p>If we only removed +2 there are two cases:<\/p> <ul> <li>there is tree with two +1 moves, chose one of those trees -&gt; don't remove +2 for the tree and instead remove two of those +1, this will help us remove at least one +1 and because n &gt;= 2 we also will remove at least one +2, and it will decrease the time for sure.<\/li> <li>the remaining case is following: we only removed +2 and all trees has no more than single +1 move. This means the number of +1 &lt;= n, and the number of +2 &gt;= n. The time of last +1 is &lt;= n * 2 \u2014 1 and the time of last +2 is &gt;= 2 * n. This means that the last move is definitely +2, so if we remove all +2 this will remove at least one +2 and this will definitely reduce the time.<\/li> <\/ul><\/li> <\/ul><\/div><\/div>","comment_rating":-8,"timestamp":1649635200000,"problem":"C","label":"HintExp","round_id":"\/contest\/1661","round_name":"Educational Codeforces Round 126 (Rated for Div. 2)"},"https:\/\/codeforces.com\/blog\/entry\/101790?#comment-903408":{"id":903408,"father_id":-1,"username":"\/profile\/AngrySeal","text":"<p>In problem A I coded a solution just leaving the smallest numbers on $$$a$$$, just if $$$b_i &gt; a_i$$$ then swap and it worked<\/p> <p>Does anyone know why this works?

And here is my explanation. Imagine you decided how many portals you would need to insert, it will cost $$$f(x, k)$$$. But we can think of it in a new way: there is list of \"upgrades\". Each upgrade $$$i$$$ costs $$$f(x, i - 1) - f(x, i)$$$. So first upgrade costs $$$f(x, 0) - f(x, 1)$$$. Next upgrade costs $$$f(x, 1) - f(x, 2)$$$ and so on. So if we do 3 upgrades, we have to pay $$$f(x, 0) - f(x, 1) + f(x, 1) - f(x, 2) + f(x, 2) - f(x, 3) = f(x, 0) - f(x, 3) =$$$ how much we reduced cost from the initial cost. So we can rephrase question into what minimum number of upgrades we need to have their sum cost $$$\\geq$$$ difference how much we exceed the limit. Theoretical best way to do this is to pick most valuable upgrades. The only problem is... if we want to take upgrade $$$f(x, i) - f(x, i + 1)$$$ we also had to take all upgrades $$$f(x, j) - f(x, j + 1)$$$ where $$$j &lt; i$$$. But the property $$$f(x, k) - f(x, k + 1) \\geq f(x, k + 1) - f(x, k + 2)$$$ exactly implies that if we pick upgrade later, it means we already picked upgrade before, because it has greater or equal cost! So this property allows us to pick most valuable upgrades without violation of upgrades order.<\/p><\/li> <\/ul>","comment_rating":1,"timestamp":1649635200000,"problem":"Irrelevant","label":"HintExp","round_id":"\/contest\/1661","round_name":"Educational Codeforces Round 126 (Rated for Div. 2)"},"https:\/\/codeforces.com\/blog\/entry\/101790?#comment-903744":{"id":903744,"father_id":903423,"username":"\/profile\/ParamChattani","text":"<p>Thanks for explanation of 1661F , I have understood it partially.

(0,1)$$$ (zero-indexed). Let this array be $$$a_{i}$$$ and let' call this way of ordering <strong>forward order<\/strong>. Similarly, let the reverse of $$$a_{i}$$$ be $$$b_{i}$$$ and let's call way of ordering be <strong>backward order<\/strong>. Let's consider the case when we enter the cell $$$(i,0)$$$ in time $$$t$$$ and til then we moved snakely(?). Then, what we want to compute is:<\/p>   <center>$$$ f_{i}(t) := \\text {Total time taken to move from $$$a_{i}$$$ to $$$a_{2m-i-1}$$$ when we enter $$$a_{i}$$$ in time $$$t$$$} $$$<\/center> <p>Similarly, when we enter the cell $$$(i,1)$$$ in time $$$t$$$ then what we want to compute is:<\/p>   <center>$$$ g_{i}(t) := \\text {Total time taken to move from $$$b_{i}$$$ to $$$b_{2m-i-1}$$$ when we enter $$$b_{i}$$$ in time $$$t$$$} $$$<\/center> <p>Now, these two cases are almost equivalent, so I'll ignore the latter case here. Let's call an element $$$a_{j}$$$ <strong>blocking<\/strong> to $$$a_{i}$$$ if we enter $$$a_{i}$$$ in time $$$a_{i}+1$$$ we cannot move to $$$a_{j}$$$ without being stuck (which means that we cannot enter $$$a_{j}$$$ without being stuck at $$$a_{j-1}$$$). Then it is obvious that $$$a_{j} \\gt a_{i} + j - i$$$ must hold. We only need to consider blocking elements to $$$a_{i}$$$ because the total time taken to reach $$$a_{2m-i-1}$$$ from $$$a_{i}$$$ only depends on the last blocking element with position less than or equal to $$$2m-i-1$$$ (Let's call this position $$$p_{i}$$$). Now, it follows that:<\/p>   <center>$$$ f_{i}(a_{i}+1) = 2m - i - p_{i} + a_{p_{i}} $$$<\/center> <p>And if we let $$$q_{i}(t)$$$ be the first position of blocking element to $$$a_{i}$$$ when we enter $$$a_{i}$$$ in time $$$t$$$, then it also follows that:<\/p>   <center>$$$ f_{i}(t)=2m-i-p_{q_{i}(t)}+a_{p_{q_{i}(t)}} $$$<\/center> <p>Notice that if we store $$$a_{i}-i$$$ for each $$$i$$$ then $$$q_{i}(t)$$$ can easily be calculated using segment tree (we only need to find the first position $$$j (\\gt i)$$$ such that $$$a_{j} - j \\geq t - i$$$). Also, if we store position of $$$2^k$$$th blocking element to $$$a_{i}$$$ when we enter $$$a_{i}$$$ in time $$$a_{i}+1$$$ for each $$$i$$$ and $$$k$$$, $$$p_{i}$$$ can also be calculated easily using binary lifting. The formulas are quite ugly but I tried my best to explain my logic. <\/p>","comment_rating":5,"timestamp":1659744000000,"problem":"C","label":"SolutionExp","round_id":"\/contest\/1716","round_name":"Educational Codeforces Round 133 (Rated for Div. 2)"},"https:\/\/codeforces.com\/blog\/entry\/105653?#comment-940335":{"id":940335,"father_id":-1,"username":"\/profile\/epsilon_573","text":"<p><a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/AF-A0lmEQiE\">Video Solution<\/a> for Problem C.<\/p>","comment_rating":0,"timestamp":1659744000000,"problem":"Irrelevant","label":"Irrelevant","round_id":"\/contest\/1716","round_name":"Educational Codeforces Round 133 (Rated for Div. 2)"},"https:\/\/codeforces.com\/blog\/entry\/105653?#comment-940802":{"id":940802,"father_id":-1,"username":"\/profile\/kriminalac_2","text":"<p>Can somebody help with this submision, It takes O(m) time and I get time limit. <a href=\"https:\/\/codeforces.com\/contest\/1716\/submission\/167315560\">https:\/\/codeforces.com\/contest\/1716\/submission\/167315560<\/a><\/p>","comment_rating":0,"timestamp":1659744000000,"problem":"C","label":"SubQuestion","round_id":"\/contest\/1716","round_name":"Educational Codeforces Round 133 (Rated for Div. 2)"},"https:\/\/codeforces.com\/blog\/entry\/105653?#comment-940815":{"id":940815,"father_id":940802,"username":"\/profile\/BledDest","text":"<p>You fill the calc array until N in each test case, that's why it takes so much time \u2014 it now works in $$$O(tN)$$$<\/p>","comment_rating":0,"timestamp":1659744000000,"problem":"C","label":"FixingExp","round_id":"\/contest\/1716","round_name":"Educational Codeforces Round 133 (Rated for Div. 2)"},"https:\/\/codeforces.com\/blog\/entry\/105653?#comment-940870":{"id":940870,"father_id":940815,"username":"\/profile\/kriminalac_2","text":"<p>Thank you!!<\/p>","comment_rating":0,"timestamp":1659830400000,"problem":"Irrelevant","label":"Irrelevant","round_id":"\/contest\/1716","round_name":"Educational Codeforces Round 133 (Rated for Div. 2)"},"https:\/\/codeforces.com\/blog\/entry\/105653?#comment-941021":{"id":941021,"father_id":-1,"username":"\/profile\/electronaota","text":"<p>F can also solved this way: The answer can be represented as:<\/p>   <center>$$$ \\begin{align} \\sum_{t=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{t}t^k(\\lceil{m\/2}\\rceil)^t(m - \\lceil m\/2 \\rceil)^{n-t} \\end{align} $$$<\/center> <p>If we let $$$p$$$ $$$=$$$ $$$ \\frac {\\lceil {m\/2} \\rceil}{(m - \\lceil{m\/2}\\rceil)}$$$ then our objective is to compute the following sum:<\/p>   <center>$$$ \\begin{align} (m - \\lceil{m\/2}\\rceil)^{n}\\sum_{t=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{t}t^{k}p^t \\end{align} $$$<\/center> <p>Let:<\/p>   <center>$$$ \\begin{align} dp(i) = \\sum_{t=0}^{n}\\binom{n}{t} t^i p^t \\\\ f_{i}(x) = \\frac {d}{dx^i}{(1+x)^n} \\end{align} $$$<\/center> <p>Then it's clear that the answer is $$$dp(k) (m - \\lceil{m\/2}\\rceil) ^ {n}$$$.

Because for the paths from $$$u$$$ to $$$v$$$, where $$$u=4,5,6$$$ and $$$v=7$$$, the value $$$2$$$ will definitly appear exactly once.<\/p> <p>For the same reason, edge $$$(4, 1)$$$ will contribute $$$3\\times 3$$$ to the answer.<\/p> <p>Obviously, the edges with different values can't influence each other, so You can calculate the different values of edges partly.<\/p> <p>Here is how to calculate the answer of edges with same value.<\/p> <p>Firstly, get the <strong>'bracket order'<\/strong> of the tree. Let $$$L[u]$$$ and $$$R[u]$$$ be the begining and ending indices of $$$u$$$ in the <strong>'bracket order'<\/strong>.<\/p> <p>It's another kind of Euler Tour of Tree. Instead of output the number as soon as you visit a node, you will output the number only when you first visit the node or finish visiting the node.<\/p> <p>I don't know how to translate <strong>'bracket order'<\/strong> to English since I'm Chinese and my English is poor. For example, the <strong>'bracket order'<\/strong> of the tree in the illustration is $$$\\texttt{4 5 5 6 7 7 6 1 2 2 3 3 1 4}$$$, hope you can understand what I want to express from the example. Or maybe you can see my code in the end.<\/p> <p>Then, for a tree, cut the edges <strong>in dfs order<\/strong> and split the subtrees out, and cut the edges in a subtree recursively.<\/p>   <pre><code>function Cut(int CurL, int CurR, int &amp;CurE):\n    for CurE in [CurL, CurR]:\n        cur_real_size -= size[v]\n        append value of Cut(L[v], R[v], CurE) to real_subtree_size\n    for val in real_subtree_size:\n        answer += val * cur_real_size\n    return cur_real_size\n\/\/ edges are sorted in dfs order, so an edge have a dfs order, you can judge whether the edge is in the subtree or not.\n\/\/ CurE means the index of the edge you are visiting\n<\/code><\/pre> <p>When you cut the subtree recursively and update <code>CurE<\/code>, <code>CurE<\/code> is increasing and always less than $$$O(n)$$$.

When there are no overlaps remaining, we need to turn everything that isn't 1 into a 1, so we count how many non-1s we have, add that to our operation count, and get our final answer.<\/p>","comment_rating":3,"timestamp":1662681600000,"problem":"C","label":"HintExp","round_id":"\/contest\/1728","round_name":"Educational Codeforces Round 135 (Rated for Div. 2)"},"https:\/\/codeforces.com\/blog\/entry\/106805?#comment-952088":{"id":952088,"father_id":951868,"username":"\/profile\/sen314","text":"<p>Even if the limit on C was larger, this algorithm would be fine if we just replace $$$9$$$ by the max digits that any of the array element can have.<\/p>","comment_rating":1,"timestamp":1662768000000,"problem":"C","label":"FixingExp","round_id":"\/contest\/1728","round_name":"Educational Codeforces Round 135 (Rated for Div. 2)"},"https:\/\/codeforces.com\/blog\/entry\/106805?#comment-951873":{"id":951873,"father_id":-1,"username":"\/profile\/OleschY","text":"<p>I'm going to link this $$$O(n)$$$ solution for <strong>Problem D<\/strong> here: <a href=\"https:\/\/codeforces.com\/blog\/entry\/106726?#comment-951491\">https:\/\/codeforces.com\/blog\/entry\/106726?#comment-951491<\/a><\/p>","comment_rating":11,"timestamp":1662681600000,"problem":"D","label":"TimeComExp","round_id":"\/contest\/1728","round_name":"Educational Codeforces Round 135 (Rated for Div. 2)"},"https:\/\/codeforces.com\/blog\/entry\/106805?#comment-951882":{"id":951882,"father_id":-1,"username":"\/profile\/tezk","text":"<p>I'll copy my approach for problem D from the annoucement :<\/p> <p>First, because Alice play first and the length of the string is even, Alice can force Bob to take any particular character in the string by simply never take it.
