Here is how I solved problem C. The problem gives as multiple queries and an array. Each query asks us to see if an element is in
the array or not. To solve the problem, I sorted the array in ascending order using merge sort and for each query I used binary search to find
if the element is in array or not. Total complexity is $$$N*log(N) + Q*log(N)$$$. Here is my submission: <submission link> <<===>> SolutionExp
There is no need to solve the problem using sorting and binary search, a hash can suffice. <<===>> HintExp

prompt: %rule%
<p>Question on problem D. There is an approach that calculates the same as in the editorial, but in a slightly different way, and gets WA. The solution is the following: let's calculate $$$dp_i,_j$$$ — the number of ways to achieve $$$i$$$ using $$$j$$$ steps. $$$dp_0,_0 = 1$$$. Transition is presented in full form and can be calculated faster.</p> <p>$$$dp_i,_j$$$ = $$$\sum_{w=1, q=k+j-1}^{i - wq &gt;= 0} dp_{i - wq},_{j - 1}$$$</p> <p>What is the difference between calculated $$$dp_i,_j$$$ from the solution described above and calculated $$$dp_s,_i$$$ from the editorial?</p> <<===>> 
response: SubQuestion

|^_^|

prompt: %rule%
 
<p>I'm a little confused by the expression, since it has a single summation controlled by two variables, so do you mean that we try every possible combination of $$$w$$$ and $$$q$$$ that satisfies $$$w \geq 1$$$, $$$q \geq k + j - 1$$$, and $$$i - wq \geq 0$$$? </p> <p>I think a simple counterexample is $$$dp_{3, 1}$$$ for $$$k = 2$$$ (the third entry in the sample output 2 of the problem). Your formula would include $$$dp_{0, 0} = 1$$$ ($$$w = 1$$$, $$$q = 3$$$) in the summation, but the actual value of $$$dp_{3, 1}$$$ is $$$0$$$.</p> <p>My guess is that your approach allows skipping steps, e.g., it allows you to take a step of size $$$(k + i + 1)$$$ without taking a step of size $$$(k + i)$$$. The problem requires that you must take at least one step for each value between $$$k$$$ and the largest step size inclusive. </p> <<===>> 
response: SubQuestion

|^_^|

prompt: %rule%
 
<p>I think what they mean by the 2 variables is that, $$$q$$$ is the <strong>constant</strong> denoting the number whose multiple was the last step length, i.e, $$$q = k + (j - 1)$$$ and $$$w$$$ varies freely. Hence for $$$dp[3][1]$$$, $$$q$$$ can't be 3.</p> <p><a class="rated-user user-blue" href="/profile/Romiros" title="Expert Romiros">Romiros</a> : Your approach is correct (and is in fact the same as the editorial solution, except that your DP takes contribution from old states, while the editorial's solution provides contribution to new states).</p> <p>You have 2 small bugs in your implementation though.

<p>In essence, the problem asks for you to get the sum of F^k for all combination of ball selection.

prompt: %rule%
 
<p>If $$$n \bmod 3 = 0$$$, then the answer is $$$\frac{n}{3}$$$.</p> <p>If $$$n \bmod 3 = 1$$$, then there are two cases. For $$$n = 1$$$ (the only special case), the answer is $$$2$$$. Otherwise, the answer is $$$\frac{n - 4}{3} + 2$$$. Since we excluded the special case of $$$n = 1$$$, the value of $$$n$$$ must be at least $$$4$$$, and $$$n - 4$$$ must be divisible by $$$3$$$. So we can keep taking $$$3$$$-length steps until we have $$$4$$$ left, which we can cover with two $$$2$$$-length steps.</p> <p>If $$$n \bmod 3 = 2$$$, then the answer is $$$\frac{n - 2}{3} + 1$$$. Keep taking $$$3$$$-length steps until you have $$$2$$$ left, which you cover with a single $$$2$$$-length step. </p> <p>Note that your suggestion of using $$$\frac{n}{2}$$$ for $$$n \bmod 2 = 0$$$ is not necessarily optimal, e.g., you can reach $$$8$$$ using $$$3 + 3 + 2$$$, which is 3 steps instead of $$$\frac{8}{2} = 4$$$.</p> <<===>>

<p>First, let's normalize the array in such a way that the order of elements is $$$(0,0) =&gt; (1,0) =&gt; (2,0)...=&gt; (m-1,0) =&gt; (m-1, 1) =&gt; (m - 2, 1) =&gt; ... (0,1)$$$ (zero-indexed). Let this array be $$$a_{i}$$$ and let' call this way of ordering <strong>forward order</strong>. Similarly, let the reverse of $$$a_{i}$$$ be $$$b_{i}$$$ and let's call way of ordering be <strong>backward order</strong>. Let's consider the case when we enter the cell $$$(i,0)$$$ in time $$$t$$$ and til then we moved snakely(?). Then, what we want to compute is:</p>   <center>$$$ f_{i}(t) := \text {Total time taken to move from $$$a_{i}$$$ to $$$a_{2m-i-1}$$$ when we enter $$$a_{i}$$$ in time $$$t$$$} $$$</center> <p>Similarly, when we enter the cell $$$(i,1)$$$ in time $$$t$$$ then what we want to compute is:</p>   <center>$$$ g_{i}(t) := \text {Total time taken to move from $$$b_{i}$$$ to $$$b_{2m-i-1}$$$ when we enter $$$b_{i}$$$ in time $$$t$$$} $$$</center> <p>Now, these two cases are almost equivalent, so I'll ignore the latter case here. Let's call an element $$$a_{j}$$$ <strong>blocking</strong> to $$$a_{i}$$$ if we enter $$$a_{i}$$$ in time $$$a_{i}+1$$$ we cannot move to $$$a_{j}$$$ without being stuck (which means that we cannot enter $$$a_{j}$$$ without being stuck at $$$a_{j-1}$$$). Then it is obvious that $$$a_{j} \gt a_{i} + j - i$$$ must hold. We only need to consider blocking elements to $$$a_{i}$$$ because the total time taken to reach $$$a_{2m-i-1}$$$ from $$$a_{i}$$$ only depends on the last blocking element with position less than or equal to $$$2m-i-1$$$ (Let's call this position $$$p_{i}$$$). Now, it follows that:</p>   <center>$$$ f_{i}(a_{i}+1) = 2m - i - p_{i} + a_{p_{i}} $$$</center> <p>And if we let $$$q_{i}(t)$$$ be the first position of blocking element to $$$a_{i}$$$ when we enter $$$a_{i}$$$ in time $$$t$$$, then it also follows that:</p>   <center>$$$ f_{i}(t)=2m-i-p_{q_{i}(t)}+a_{p_{q_{i}(t)}} $$$</center> <p>Notice that if we store $$$a_{i}-i$$$ for each $$$i$$$ then $$$q_{i}(t)$$$ can easily be calculated using segment tree (we only need to find the first position $$$j (\gt i)$$$ such that $$$a_{j} - j \geq t - i$$$). Also, if we store position of $$$2^k$$$th blocking element to $$$a_{i}$$$ when we enter $$$a_{i}$$$ in time $$$a_{i}+1$$$ for each $$$i$$$ and $$$k$$$, $$$p_{i}$$$ can also be calculated easily using binary lifting. The formulas are quite ugly but I tried my best to explain my logic. </p> <<===>>

AlgoExp   -  A comment which states the algorithm used and the submission link with little to no information. 
TimeComExp  - A comment which states the complexity and the submission link with little to no information.
FixingExp   - A comment which explains or gives a hint in how to solve a specific bug in an implementation
TextExp    - A comment which explains the result of an output test for a given problem. 
QuestionExp   -  A relevant question about a specific problem in the contest. It should have a relevant answer in comment subtree.
SubQuestion  -  A comment which asks insights about why a submission fails. 
TestQuestion  -  A comment which asks insights about the result of a specific input test. 
Irrelevant   -  Any other comment which doesn't fit in the labels defined above.  

A comment from the tree will have the following structure:

The conversation from now on will be like this: I will provide some comments you will label it.

For example:
I really loved this round!. <<===>> Irrelevant.
Yeah it was pretty cool especially problem C which can be solved  with binary search. <submission link>. <<===>> AlgoExp
Here is how I solved problem C. The problem gives as multiple queries and an array. Each query asks us to see if an element is in
the array or not. To solve the problem, I sorted the array in ascending order using merge sort and for each query I used binary search to find
if the element is in array or not. Total complexity is $$$N*log(N) + Q*log(N)$$$. Here is my submission: <submission link> <<===>> SolutionExp
There is no need to solve the problem using sorting and binary search, a hash can suffice. <<===>> HintExp
I solved the problem in O(n). Here is my submission <submission link> <<===>> TimeComExp
How to solve problem D?? <<===>> QuestionExp
Can somebody tell me why I am getting wrong answer on preset 3, here is my submission <submission link> <<===>> SubQuestion
You should do floating division and not integer division. <<===>> FixingExp
Why the result in the first test case is 1 and not 3? <<===>> TestQuestion
In the statement it says that odd numbers should be counted.  <<===>> TextExp


Please encode the previous explanation of the labelling in a variable named %rule%. Whenever I use %rule% in a text, you should follow the exact rules I specified
above.
response: Of course, I understand your request. Please provide the comments you'd like me to label, and I will apply the labeling rules based on the %rule% you provided.

<p>You fill the calc array until N in each test case, that's why it takes so much time — it now works in $$$O(tN)$$$</p> <<===>>

<p>F can also solved this way: The answer can be represented as:</p>   <center>$$$ \begin{align} \sum_{t=0}^{n} \binom{n}{t}t^k(\lceil{m/2}\rceil)^t(m - \lceil m/2 \rceil)^{n-t} \end{align} $$$</center> <p>If we let $$$p$$$ $$$=$$$ $$$ \frac {\lceil {m/2} \rceil}{(m - \lceil{m/2}\rceil)}$$$ then our objective is to compute the following sum:</p>   <center>$$$ \begin{align} (m - \lceil{m/2}\rceil)^{n}\sum_{t=0}^{n} \binom{n}{t}t^{k}p^t \end{align} $$$</center> <p>Let:</p>   <center>$$$ \begin{align} dp(i) = \sum_{t=0}^{n}\binom{n}{t} t^i p^t \\ f_{i}(x) = \frac {d}{dx^i}{(1+x)^n} \end{align} $$$</center> <p>Then it's clear that the answer is $$$dp(k) (m - \lceil{m/2}\rceil) ^ {n}$$$. Now it follows that:</p>   <center>$$$ \begin{align} f_{i}(p)p^{i} &amp;= \sum_{t=0}^{n} \binom{n}{t} t(t-1)(t-2)\dots(t-i+1)p^{t} \\ &amp;= \sum_{t=0}^{n} \binom{n}{t} \sum_{j=0}^{i} s(i,j) t^{j} p^{t} \\ &amp;= \sum_{t=0}^{n} \sum_{j=0}^{i} s(i,j)\binom{n}{t} t^{j} p^{t} \\ &amp;= \sum_{j=0}^{i} s(i,j) \sum_{t=0}^{n}\binom{n}{t} t^{j} p^{t} \\ &amp;= \sum_{j=0}^{i} s(i,j) dp(j) \end{align} $$$</center> <p>where $$$s(i,j)$$$ is stirling number of the first kind. If we let $$$g_{i} = f_{i}(p) p^{i}$$$, then:</p>   <center>$$$ \begin{align} g_{i} = \sum_{j=0}^{i} s(i,j) dp(j) \iff dp(i) = \sum_{j=0}^{i} S(i,j) g_{j} \end{align} $$$</center> <p>where $$$S(i,j)$$$ is stirling number of the second kind.</p> <<===>>

<p>For problems like C, I found it's incredibly time-consuming for me to get every +1/-1/0 right, like the indices starting from 0/1, the number of steps required starting from the first cell/before the first cell. Does anybody have suggestions for dealing with this?</p> <<===>>
