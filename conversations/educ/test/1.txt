prompt: Hello ChatGPT. I want you remember all your knowledge in competitive programming and help me label a couple of things. 

I will give you a couple of comments from Codeforces from a specific blog round. I want you to label each comment based on the following labels SolutionExp, HintExp, AlgoExp, TimeComExp, FixingExp, TextExp, QuestionExp, SubQuestion, TestQuestion, Irrelevant. A short description of the labels can be seen below :

SolutionExp  -  A comment which explains in detail how to solve a problem, more like a step by step guide. 
HintExp   -  It can be viewed as a sparse variant of SolutionExp in which just various elements from an entire solution are presented. 
AlgoExp   -  A comment which states the algorithm used and the submission link with little to no information. 
TimeComExp  - A comment which states the complexity and the submission link with little to no information.
FixingExp   - A comment which explains or gives a hint in how to solve a specific bug in an implementation
TextExp    - A comment which explains the result of an output test for a given problem. 
QuestionExp   -  A relevant question about a specific problem in the contest. It should have a relevant answer in comment subtree.
SubQuestion  -  A comment which asks insights about why a submission fails. 
TestQuestion  -  A comment which asks insights about the result of a specific input test. 
Irrelevant   -  Any other comment which doesn't fit in the labels defined above.  

A comment from the tree will have the following structure:
Text <<===>> the label of the comment.


The conversation from now on will be like this: I will provide some comments you will label it.

For example:

Yeah it was pretty cool especially problem C which can be solved  with binary search. <submission link>. <<===>> AlgoExp
Here is how I solved problem C. The problem gives as multiple queries and an array. Each query asks us to see if an element is in
the array or not. To solve the problem, I sorted the array in ascending order using merge sort and for each query I used binary search to find
if the element is in array or not. Total complexity is $$$N*log(N) + Q*log(N)$$$. Here is my submission: <submission link> <<===>> SolutionExp
There is no need to solve the problem using sorting and binary search, a hash can suffice. <<===>> HintExp

Please encode the previous explanation of the labelling in a variable named %rule%. Whenever I use %rule% in a text, you should follow the exact rules I specified
above.
response: Of course, I understand your request. Please provide me with the comments you'd like me to label, and I'll follow the labeling rules you've specified using the %rule% variable.

<p>In problem D why we process the queries backward?</p> <<===>> 
response: QuestionExp

|^_^|

prompt: %rule%
 
<p>When you process backwards, the query is equivalent to "color all squares in this row and column which are not yet colored". This way, each square will be colored at most once. So now your answer will be $$$k$$$ raised to some power(which is actually the number of queries where at least one square was colored).</p> <<===>>

prompt: %rule%
 
<p>I processed all the queries forwards but ended up getting WA, but I am unable to understand how is there a difference between processing it forwards or backwards? Even if we are doing it forwards then, yes it might be possible that some square is getting colored more than once but in the end I am counting the different number of colors for all the squares so that shouldn't make a difference.</p> <<===>> 
response: TextExp

|^_^|

prompt: %rule%
 
<p>For each query you want to determine something that happens in the future â€” in the later queries. So to tell something about query $$$i$$$, you have to first process queries $$$i+1$$$..$$$q$$$. That is exactly the same as going backwards over queries: you first determine the status of the query, then add the information about it to some data structure. </p> <<===>>

<p>No need for FFT in problem since we need only sum of those Stirling's number and this can be done in O(i): Since S(i,j) = sum(1&lt;=t&lt;=j) C(j,t) * t^i * (-1)^(j+t) / j! we have: <br/> S(i,1)+S(i,2)+..+S(i,k) = sum(1&lt;=j&lt;=k,1&lt;=t&lt;=j)( t^i * (-1)^(j-t)/((j-t)! * t!) ). <br/> Let d = j-t, then ans = sum(1&lt;=t&lt;=k,0&lt;=d&lt;=k-t)( (t^i/t!)*((-1)^d / d!) ) iterate over t and sum(0&lt;=d&lt;=k-t) ((-1)^d / d!) can be precomputed</p> <<===>>

<p>I really like this formula. It is elegant and works under any prime modulo. Thank you for sharing it!</p> <p>Here's a more detailed explanation and another way to look at it: Let $$$n \geq 1$$$ be a fixed integer.<br/>As in tutorial, let $$$p_i = \frac{(-1)^i}{i!}$$$ and $$$q_j = \frac{j^n}{j!}$$$.<br/>Then $$$S(n, k) = \sum\limits_{i+j=k} p_i \cdot q_j$$$. </p> <p>Consider a matrix $$$M$$$ in which $$$M_{i, j} = p_i \cdot q_j$$$ for $$$0 \leq i, j \leq n$$$.<br/>Then $$$S(n, k)$$$ is the sum of entries on the antidiagonal $$$i+j = k$$$.</p> <p>Suppose we want to find $$$S(n, 0) + S(n, 1) + ... S(n, k)$$$ for some $$$k$$$.<br/>That is to sum the entries above the antidiagonal $$$i+j=k$$$.<br/>We can sum these values column by column.<br/>For a fixed column $$$j$$$, the sum is $$$q_j \cdot \sum\limits_{i=0}^{k-j} p_i$$$.<br/>Thus, $$$S(n, 0) + S(n, 1) + ... S(n, k) = \sum\limits_{j=0}^{k} q_j \cdot \sum\limits_{i=0}^{k-j} p_i$$$. </p> <p>To compute this efficiently, note that $$$\sum\limits_{i=0}^{k-j} p_i$$$ is just the sum over a prefix of $$$p$$$.</p> <p>My implementation:  <submission link> </p> <<===>> 
response: SolutionExp

prompt: %rule%
 
<p>I have a question, though. To compute $$$S(i,1)+S(i,2)+...+S(i,k)$$$, the formula requires to find $$$t^i$$$ over $$$t=0,1,...,k$$$. Can this be computed (or precomputed) in $$$O(i)$$$?</p> <<===>> 
response: QuestionExp

|^_^|

prompt: %rule%
 
<p>Oh I get it.<br/>We can use linear sieve to find all primes $$$p$$$ and compute $$$p^i$$$.<br/>For a composite $$$x = a \cdot b$$$, compute $$$x^i$$$ as $$$a^i \cdot b^i$$$.<br/>This is $$$O(k \log i / \log k) = O(i)$$$</p> <<===>>

response: Label: QuestionExp

prompt: %rule%
 
<p>Let's say after i'th query you get all rows (column can be anything) in the query. This would mean that whatever colours were present in all the cells before, are updated (possibly to the same colour but updated for sure) so any query that was processed before i'th query is no longer relevant to the final state. If however, we do process them in reverse order, it will update colour of some cell which shouldn't have been the case. Same goes for queries covering all columns instead of rows hence we have to check for both.</p> <<===>>
