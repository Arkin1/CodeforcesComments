prompt: Hello ChatGPT. I want you remember all your knowledge in competitive programming and help me label a couple of things. 

I will give you a comment tree from Codeforces from a specific blog round. I want you to label each comment from the tree based on the following labels SolutionExp, HintExp, AlgoExp, TimeComExp, FixingExp, TextExp, QuestionExp, SubQuestion, TestQuestion, Irrelevant. A short description of the labels can be seen below :

SolutionExp  -  A comment which explains in detail how to solve a problem, more like a step by step guide. 
HintExp   -  It can be viewed as a sparse variant of SolutionExp in which just various elements from an entire solution are presented. 
AlgoExp   -  A comment which states the algorithm used and the submission link with little to no information. 
TimeComExp  - A comment which states the complexity and the submission link with little to no information.
FixingExp   - A comment which explains or gives a hint in how to solve a specific bug in an implementation
TextExp    - A comment which explains the result of an output test for a given problem. 
QuestionExp   -  A relevant question about a specific problem in the contest. It should have a relevant answer in comment subtree.
SubQuestion  -  A comment which asks insights about why a submission fails. 
TestQuestion  -  A comment which asks insights about the result of a specific input test. 
Irrelevant   -  Any other comment which doesn't fit in the labels defined above.  

A comment from the tree will have the following structure:
(Id of the father comment or -1 if the comment is a root, id of a comment) -> the text of the comment.


The conversation from now on will be like this: I will provide a comment tree, you will label it.

For example:
(-1, 2233) => I really loved this round!.
(2233,  3312) => Yeah it was pretty cool especially problem C which can be solved  with binary search. <submission link>.
(-1, 2444) => Here is how I solved problem C. The problem gives as multiple queries and an array. Each query asks us to see if an element is in
the array or not. To solve the problem, I sorted the array in ascending order using merge sort and for each query I used binary search to find
if the element is in array or not. Total complexity is $$$N*log(N) + Q*log(N)$$$. Here is my submission: <submission link>
(2444, 2467) => There is no need to solve the problem using sorting and binary search, a hash can suffice.
(2444, 2468) => I solved the problem in O(n). Here is my submission <submission link>
(-1, 2313) => How to solve problem D??
(-1, 2314) => Can somebody tell me why I am getting wrong answer on preset 3, here is my submission <submission link>
(2314, 2315) => You should do floating division and not integer division.
(-1, 2316) => Why the result in the first test case is 1 and not 3?
(2316, 2317) => In the statement it says that odd numbers should be counted.

The result should be of the following form. As noted instead of displaying the comment text, you should display the label:
(-1, 2233) => Irrelevant.
(2233, 3312) => AlgoExp
(-1, 2444) => SolutionExp
(2444, 2467) => HintExp
(2444, 2468) => TimeComExp

(-1, 2314) => SubQuestion
(2314, 2315) => FixingExp
(-1, 2316) => TestQuestion
(2316,2317) => TextExp

Please encode the previous explanation of the labelling in a variable named %rule%. Whenever I use %rule% in a text, you should follow the exact rules I specified
above.
response: Certainly, I understand your request. Please provide the comment tree, and I will label each comment based on the rules you've specified in %rule%.

prompt: %rule%
((-1, 940222)) => <p>Question on problem D. There is an approach that calculates the same as in the editorial, but in a slightly different way, and gets WA. The solution is the following: let's calculate $$$dp_i,_j$$$ — the number of ways to achieve $$$i$$$ using $$$j$$$ steps. $$$dp_0,_0 = 1$$$. Transition is presented in full form and can be calculated faster.</p> <p>$$$dp_i,_j$$$ = $$$\sum_{w=1, q=k+j-1}^{i - wq &gt;= 0} dp_{i - wq},_{j - 1}$$$</p> <p>What is the difference between calculated $$$dp_i,_j$$$ from the solution described above and calculated $$$dp_s,_i$$$ from the editorial?</p>
((940222, 940272)) => <p>I'm a little confused by the expression, since it has a single summation controlled by two variables, so do you mean that we try every possible combination of $$$w$$$ and $$$q$$$ that satisfies $$$w \geq 1$$$, $$$q \geq k + j - 1$$$, and $$$i - wq \geq 0$$$? </p> <p>I think a simple counterexample is $$$dp_{3, 1}$$$ for $$$k = 2$$$ (the third entry in the sample output 2 of the problem). Your formula would include $$$dp_{0, 0} = 1$$$ ($$$w = 1$$$, $$$q = 3$$$) in the summation, but the actual value of $$$dp_{3, 1}$$$ is $$$0$$$.</p> <p>My guess is that your approach allows skipping steps, e.g., it allows you to take a step of size $$$(k + i + 1)$$$ without taking a step of size $$$(k + i)$$$. The problem requires that you must take at least one step for each value between $$$k$$$ and the largest step size inclusive. </p>
((940272, 940368)) => <p>I think what they mean by the 2 variables is that, $$$q$$$ is the <strong>constant</strong> denoting the number whose multiple was the last step length, i.e, $$$q = k + (j - 1)$$$ and $$$w$$$ varies freely. Hence for $$$dp[3][1]$$$, $$$q$$$ can't be 3.</p> <p><a class="rated-user user-blue" href="/profile/Romiros" title="Expert Romiros">Romiros</a> : Your approach is correct (and is in fact the same as the editorial solution, except that your DP takes contribution from old states, while the editorial's solution provides contribution to new states).</p> <p>You have 2 small bugs in your implementation though. You can take a look at <a href="https://cfstress.com/status/15995">Ticket 15995</a> from <strong>CF Stress</strong> for a counter example.</p>   <div class="spoiler"><b class="spoiler-title"> Hints for Bug 1</b><div class="spoiler-content" style="display: none;"><p>There are 2 possible ways to reach 12 for the given counter example. $$$(0 \rightarrow 12)$$$ and $$$(0 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 7 \rightarrow 12)$$$. </p><p>Try to print the entire DP table and take a look at entries $$$dp[12][3]$$$ and $$$dp[7][2]$$$ and $$$dp[3][1]$$$.</p></div></div>   <div class="spoiler"><b class="spoiler-title">Hints for Bug 2:</b><div class="spoiler-content" style="display: none;"><p>Your precompute a safe limit for $$$cnt$$$ by iterating with the smallest steps. You even multiply it by 3 to handle off by one errors. However, your current implementation results in a value of $$$cnt$$$ that is way smaller than the correct count that should be used.</p></div></div>
((940368, 940388)) => <p>Got it, thanks. But why are $$$cnt$$$ steps not enough?</p>
((940388, 940391)) => <p>$$$sum1 += K$$$ implies that the step length is $$$K$$$. Therefore, $$$K$$$ should be overwritten with $$$k+1$$$ at each stage. However, $$$K + = k + cnt$$$ makes it increment by that amount instead of overwriting it. </p>
((940391, 940410)) => <p>Oh, my bad, thanks again.</p>
((940391, 946861)) => <p>Thanks a lot </p>
((940272, 940381)) => <p>Summation controlled only by variable $$$w$$$ and continues until $$$i - wq &gt;= 0$$$, $$$wq$$$ is length of the move on $$$j$$$-th step, $$$q$$$ is the number that should divide length of the move on $$$j$$$-th step.</p> <p>The solution passes pretests and gets WA3. Somehow it counts fewer number of ways than needed.</p>
((940381, 949750)) => <p>i have the same question.i get WA3 in a slightly difference than the std.i set the max step sqrt(n)+10.is it enough?</p>
((940381, 949751)) => <p>ohhh.I know.it's not enough!max step should be calculated.can't be set sqrt(n)</p>

((940237, 940252)) => <p>In essence, the problem asks for you to get the sum of F^k for all combination of ball selection.

Let's consider the case when we enter the cell $$$(i,0)$$$ in time $$$t$$$ and til then we moved snakely(?). Then, what we want to compute is:</p>   <center>$$$ f_{i}(t) := \text {Total time taken to move from $$$a_{i}$$$ to $$$a_{2m-i-1}$$$ when we enter $$$a_{i}$$$ in time $$$t$$$} $$$</center> <p>Similarly, when we enter the cell $$$(i,1)$$$ in time $$$t$$$ then what we want to compute is:</p>   <center>$$$ g_{i}(t) := \text {Total time taken to move from $$$b_{i}$$$ to $$$b_{2m-i-1}$$$ when we enter $$$b_{i}$$$ in time $$$t$$$} $$$</center> <p>Now, these two cases are almost equivalent, so I'll ignore the latter case here. Let's call an element $$$a_{j}$$$ <strong>blocking</strong> to $$$a_{i}$$$ if we enter $$$a_{i}$$$ in time $$$a_{i}+1$$$ we cannot move to $$$a_{j}$$$ without being stuck (which means that we cannot enter $$$a_{j}$$$ without being stuck at $$$a_{j-1}$$$). Then it is obvious that $$$a_{j} \gt a_{i} + j - i$$$ must hold. We only need to consider blocking elements to $$$a_{i}$$$ because the total time taken to reach $$$a_{2m-i-1}$$$ from $$$a_{i}$$$ only depends on the last blocking element with position less than or equal to $$$2m-i-1$$$ (Let's call this position $$$p_{i}$$$). Now, it follows that:</p>   <center>$$$ f_{i}(a_{i}+1) = 2m - i - p_{i} + a_{p_{i}} $$$</center> <p>And if we let $$$q_{i}(t)$$$ be the first position of blocking element to $$$a_{i}$$$ when we enter $$$a_{i}$$$ in time $$$t$$$, then it also follows that:</p>   <center>$$$ f_{i}(t)=2m-i-p_{q_{i}(t)}+a_{p_{q_{i}(t)}} $$$</center> <p>Notice that if we store $$$a_{i}-i$$$ for each $$$i$$$ then $$$q_{i}(t)$$$ can easily be calculated using segment tree (we only need to find the first position $$$j (\gt i)$$$ such that $$$a_{j} - j \geq t - i$$$). Also, if we store position of $$$2^k$$$th blocking element to $$$a_{i}$$$ when we enter $$$a_{i}$$$ in time $$$a_{i}+1$$$ for each $$$i$$$ and $$$k$$$, $$$p_{i}$$$ can also be calculated easily using binary lifting. The formulas are quite ugly but I tried my best to explain my logic. </p>

prompt: Hello ChatGPT. I want you remember all your knowledge in competitive programming and help me label a couple of things. 

I will give you a comment tree from Codeforces from a specific blog round. I want you to label each comment from the tree based on the following labels SolutionExp, HintExp, AlgoExp, TimeComExp, FixingExp, TextExp, QuestionExp, SubQuestion, TestQuestion, Irrelevant. A short description of the labels can be seen below :

SolutionExp  -  A comment which explains in detail how to solve a problem, more like a step by step guide. 
HintExp   -  It can be viewed as a sparse variant of SolutionExp in which just various elements from an entire solution are presented. 
AlgoExp   -  A comment which states the algorithm used and the submission link with little to no information. 
TimeComExp  - A comment which states the complexity and the submission link with little to no information.
FixingExp   - A comment which explains or gives a hint in how to solve a specific bug in an implementation
TextExp    - A comment which explains the result of an output test for a given problem. 
QuestionExp   -  A relevant question about a specific problem in the contest. It should have a relevant answer in comment subtree.
SubQuestion  -  A comment which asks insights about why a submission fails. 
TestQuestion  -  A comment which asks insights about the result of a specific input test. 
Irrelevant   -  Any other comment which doesn't fit in the labels defined above.  

A comment from the tree will have the following structure:
(Id of the father comment or -1 if the comment is a root, id of a comment) -> the text of the comment.


The conversation from now on will be like this: I will provide a comment tree, you will label it.

For example:
(-1, 2233) => I really loved this round!.
(2233,  3312) => Yeah it was pretty cool especially problem C which can be solved  with binary search. <submission link>.
(-1, 2444) => Here is how I solved problem C. The problem gives as multiple queries and an array. Each query asks us to see if an element is in
the array or not. To solve the problem, I sorted the array in ascending order using merge sort and for each query I used binary search to find
if the element is in array or not. Total complexity is $$$N*log(N) + Q*log(N)$$$. Here is my submission: <submission link>
(2444, 2467) => There is no need to solve the problem using sorting and binary search, a hash can suffice.
(2444, 2468) => I solved the problem in O(n). Here is my submission <submission link>
(-1, 2313) => How to solve problem D??
(-1, 2314) => Can somebody tell me why I am getting wrong answer on preset 3, here is my submission <submission link>
(2314, 2315) => You should do floating division and not integer division.
(-1, 2316) => Why the result in the first test case is 1 and not 3?
(2316, 2317) => In the statement it says that odd numbers should be counted.

The result should be of the following form. As noted instead of displaying the comment text, you should display the label:
(-1, 2233) => Irrelevant.
(2233, 3312) => AlgoExp
(-1, 2444) => SolutionExp
(2444, 2467) => HintExp
(2444, 2468) => TimeComExp
(-1, 2313) => QuestionExp
(-1, 2314) => SubQuestion
(2314, 2315) => FixingExp
(-1, 2316) => TestQuestion
(2316,2317) => TextExp

Please encode the previous explanation of the labelling in a variable named %rule%. Whenever I use %rule% in a text, you should follow the exact rules I specified
above.
response: Certainly, I understand your request. You want me to label each comment in a comment tree from a Codeforces blog round based on specific labels, as described in %rule%. I will follow these rules to label the comments. Please provide the comment tree, and I will label each comment accordingly.

prompt: %rule%
((-1, 941021)) => <p>F can also solved this way: The answer can be represented as:</p>   <center>$$$ \begin{align} \sum_{t=0}^{n} \binom{n}{t}t^k(\lceil{m/2}\rceil)^t(m - \lceil m/2 \rceil)^{n-t} \end{align} $$$</center> <p>If we let $$$p$$$ $$$=$$$ $$$ \frac {\lceil {m/2} \rceil}{(m - \lceil{m/2}\rceil)}$$$ then our objective is to compute the following sum:</p>   <center>$$$ \begin{align} (m - \lceil{m/2}\rceil)^{n}\sum_{t=0}^{n} \binom{n}{t}t^{k}p^t \end{align} $$$</center> <p>Let:</p>   <center>$$$ \begin{align} dp(i) = \sum_{t=0}^{n}\binom{n}{t} t^i p^t \\ f_{i}(x) = \frac {d}{dx^i}{(1+x)^n} \end{align} $$$</center> <p>Then it's clear that the answer is $$$dp(k) (m - \lceil{m/2}\rceil) ^ {n}$$$. Now it follows that:</p>   <center>$$$ \begin{align} f_{i}(p)p^{i} &amp;= \sum_{t=0}^{n} \binom{n}{t} t(t-1)(t-2)\dots(t-i+1)p^{t} \\ &amp;= \sum_{t=0}^{n} \binom{n}{t} \sum_{j=0}^{i} s(i,j) t^{j} p^{t} \\ &amp;= \sum_{t=0}^{n} \sum_{j=0}^{i} s(i,j)\binom{n}{t} t^{j} p^{t} \\ &amp;= \sum_{j=0}^{i} s(i,j) \sum_{t=0}^{n}\binom{n}{t} t^{j} p^{t} \\ &amp;= \sum_{j=0}^{i} s(i,j) dp(j) \end{align} $$$</center> <p>where $$$s(i,j)$$$ is stirling number of the first kind. If we let $$$g_{i} = f_{i}(p) p^{i}$$$, then:</p>   <center>$$$ \begin{align} g_{i} = \sum_{j=0}^{i} s(i,j) dp(j) \iff dp(i) = \sum_{j=0}^{i} S(i,j) g_{j} \end{align} $$$</center> <p>where $$$S(i,j)$$$ is stirling number of the second kind.</p>
