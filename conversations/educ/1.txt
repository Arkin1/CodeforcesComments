prompt: Hello ChatGPT. I want you remember all your knowledge in competitive programming and help me label a couple of things. 

I will give you a comment tree from Codeforces from a specific blog round. I want you to label each comment from the tree based on the following labels SolutionExp, HintExp, AlgoExp, TimeComExp, FixingExp, TextExp, QuestionExp, SubQuestion, TestQuestion, Irrelevant. A short description of the labels can be seen below :

SolutionExp  -  A comment which explains in detail how to solve a problem, more like a step by step guide. 
HintExp   -  It can be viewed as a sparse variant of SolutionExp in which just various elements from an entire solution are presented. 
AlgoExp   -  A comment which states the algorithm used and the submission link with little to no information. 
TimeComExp  - A comment which states the complexity and the submission link with little to no information.
FixingExp   - A comment which explains or gives a hint in how to solve a specific bug in an implementation
TextExp    - A comment which explains the result of an output test for a given problem. 
QuestionExp   -  A relevant question about a specific problem in the contest. It should have a relevant answer in comment subtree.
SubQuestion  -  A comment which asks insights about why a submission fails. 
TestQuestion  -  A comment which asks insights about the result of a specific input test. 
Irrelevant   -  Any other comment which doesn't fit in the labels defined above.  

A comment from the tree will have the following structure:
(Id of the father comment or -1 if the comment is a root, id of a comment) -> the text of the comment.


The conversation from now on will be like this: I will provide a comment tree, you will label it.

For example:
(-1, 2233) => I really loved this round!.
(2233,  3312) => Yeah it was pretty cool especially problem C which can be solved  with binary search. <submission link>.
(-1, 2444) => Here is how I solved problem C. The problem gives as multiple queries and an array. Each query asks us to see if an element is in
the array or not. To solve the problem, I sorted the array in ascending order using merge sort and for each query I used binary search to find
if the element is in array or not. Total complexity is $$$N*log(N) + Q*log(N)$$$. Here is my submission: <submission link>
(2444, 2467) => There is no need to solve the problem using sorting and binary search, a hash can suffice.
(2444, 2468) => I solved the problem in O(n). Here is my submission <submission link>
(-1, 2313) => How to solve problem D??
(-1, 2314) => Can somebody tell me why I am getting wrong answer on preset 3, here is my submission <submission link>
(2314, 2315) => You should do floating division and not integer division.
(-1, 2316) => Why the result in the first test case is 1 and not 3?
(2316, 2317) => In the statement it says that odd numbers should be counted.

The result should be of the following form. As noted instead of displaying the comment text, you should display the label:
(-1, 2233) => Irrelevant.
(2233, 3312) => AlgoExp
(-1, 2444) => SolutionExp
(2444, 2467) => HintExp

((-1, 889304)) => <p>In problem D why we process the queries backward?</p>
((889304, 889308)) => <p>When you process backwards, the query is equivalent to "color all squares in this row and column which are not yet colored". This way, each square will be colored at most once. So now your answer will be $$$k$$$ raised to some power(which is actually the number of queries where at least one square was colored).</p>
((889308, 889314)) => <p>Got it thanku</p>
((889308, 889342)) => <p>I processed all the queries forwards but ended up getting WA, but I am unable to understand how is there a difference between processing it forwards or backwards? Even if we are doing it forwards then, yes it might be possible that some square is getting colored more than once but in the end I am counting the different number of colors for all the squares so that shouldn't make a difference.</p>
((889342, 889528)) => <p>For each query you want to determine something that happens in the future — in the later queries. So to tell something about query $$$i$$$, you have to first process queries $$$i+1$$$..$$$q$$$. That is exactly the same as going backwards over queries: you first determine the status of the query, then add the information about it to some data structure. </p>

((-1, 889602)) => <p>No need for FFT in problem since we need only sum of those Stirling's number and this can be done in O(i): Since S(i,j) = sum(1&lt;=t&lt;=j) C(j,t) * t^i * (-1)^(j+t) / j! we have: <br/> S(i,1)+S(i,2)+..+S(i,k) = sum(1&lt;=j&lt;=k,1&lt;=t&lt;=j)( t^i * (-1)^(j-t)/((j-t)! * t!) ). <br/> Let d = j-t, then ans = sum(1&lt;=t&lt;=k,0&lt;=d&lt;=k-t)( (t^i/t!)*((-1)^d / d!) ) iterate over t and sum(0&lt;=d&lt;=k-t) ((-1)^d / d!) can be precomputed</p>
((889602, 892309)) => <p>I really like this formula. It is elegant and works under any prime modulo. Thank you for sharing it!</p> <p>Here's a more detailed explanation and another way to look at it: Let $$$n \geq 1$$$ be a fixed integer.<br/>As in tutorial, let $$$p_i = \frac{(-1)^i}{i!}$$$ and $$$q_j = \frac{j^n}{j!}$$$.<br/>Then $$$S(n, k) = \sum\limits_{i+j=k} p_i \cdot q_j$$$. </p> <p>Consider a matrix $$$M$$$ in which $$$M_{i, j} = p_i \cdot q_j$$$ for $$$0 \leq i, j \leq n$$$.<br/>Then $$$S(n, k)$$$ is the sum of entries on the antidiagonal $$$i+j = k$$$.</p> <p>Suppose we want to find $$$S(n, 0) + S(n, 1) + ... S(n, k)$$$ for some $$$k$$$.<br/>That is to sum the entries above the antidiagonal $$$i+j=k$$$.<br/>We can sum these values column by column.<br/>For a fixed column $$$j$$$, the sum is $$$q_j \cdot \sum\limits_{i=0}^{k-j} p_i$$$.<br/>Thus, $$$S(n, 0) + S(n, 1) + ... S(n, k) = \sum\limits_{j=0}^{k} q_j \cdot \sum\limits_{i=0}^{k-j} p_i$$$. </p> <p>To compute this efficiently, note that $$$\sum\limits_{i=0}^{k-j} p_i$$$ is just the sum over a prefix of $$$p$$$.</p> <p>My implementation:  <submission link> </p>
((889602, 892332)) => <p>I have a question, though. To compute $$$S(i,1)+S(i,2)+...+S(i,k)$$$, the formula requires to find $$$t^i$$$ over $$$t=0,1,...,k$$$. Can this be computed (or precomputed) in $$$O(i)$$$?</p>
((892332, 892337)) => <p>Oh I get it.<br/>We can use linear sieve to find all primes $$$p$$$ and compute $$$p^i$$$.<br/>For a composite $$$x = a \cdot b$$$, compute $$$x^i$$$ as $$$a^i \cdot b^i$$$.<br/>This is $$$O(k \log i / \log k) = O(i)$$$</p>

I am not getting why this sol isn't working, it would be great if someone can suggest a test ( of reasonable length)case in which it fails . <submission link> </p> <p><strong>PS:</strong> I tried finding the array with the largest possible sum and its length (**let l **) and for all values of k &lt;= l, I added k*x to the max sum and for all k &gt; l, I checked for subarray of size k with the largest sum and printed max of ( prev_sum, (cur_sum + k*x)). </p>

prompt: Hello ChatGPT. I want you remember all your knowledge in competitive programming and help me label a couple of things. 

I will give you a comment tree from Codeforces from a specific blog round. I want you to label each comment from the tree based on the following labels SolutionExp, HintExp, AlgoExp, TimeComExp, FixingExp, TextExp, QuestionExp, SubQuestion, TestQuestion, Irrelevant. A short description of the labels can be seen below :

SolutionExp  -  A comment which explains in detail how to solve a problem, more like a step by step guide. 
HintExp   -  It can be viewed as a sparse variant of SolutionExp in which just various elements from an entire solution are presented. 
AlgoExp   -  A comment which states the algorithm used and the submission link with little to no information. 
TimeComExp  - A comment which states the complexity and the submission link with little to no information.
FixingExp   - A comment which explains or gives a hint in how to solve a specific bug in an implementation
TextExp    - A comment which explains the result of an output test for a given problem. 
QuestionExp   -  A relevant question about a specific problem in the contest. It should have a relevant answer in comment subtree.
SubQuestion  -  A comment which asks insights about why a submission fails. 
TestQuestion  -  A comment which asks insights about the result of a specific input test. 
Irrelevant   -  Any other comment which doesn't fit in the labels defined above.  

A comment from the tree will have the following structure:
(Id of the father comment or -1 if the comment is a root, id of a comment) -> the text of the comment.


The conversation from now on will be like this: I will provide a comment tree, you will label it.

For example:
(-1, 2233) => I really loved this round!.
(2233,  3312) => Yeah it was pretty cool especially problem C which can be solved  with binary search. <submission link>.
(-1, 2444) => Here is how I solved problem C. The problem gives as multiple queries and an array. Each query asks us to see if an element is in
the array or not. To solve the problem, I sorted the array in ascending order using merge sort and for each query I used binary search to find
if the element is in array or not. Total complexity is $$$N*log(N) + Q*log(N)$$$. Here is my submission: <submission link>
(2444, 2467) => There is no need to solve the problem using sorting and binary search, a hash can suffice.
(2444, 2468) => I solved the problem in O(n). Here is my submission <submission link>
(-1, 2313) => How to solve problem D??
(-1, 2314) => Can somebody tell me why I am getting wrong answer on preset 3, here is my submission <submission link>
(2314, 2315) => You should do floating division and not integer division.
(-1, 2316) => Why the result in the first test case is 1 and not 3?
(2316, 2317) => In the statement it says that odd numbers should be counted.

The result should be of the following form. As noted instead of displaying the comment text, you should display the label:
(-1, 2233) => Irrelevant.
(2233, 3312) => AlgoExp
(-1, 2444) => SolutionExp
(2444, 2467) => HintExp
(2444, 2468) => TimeComExp
(-1, 2313) => QuestionExp
(-1, 2314) => SubQuestion
(2314, 2315) => FixingExp
(-1, 2316) => TestQuestion
(2316,2317) => TextExp

Please encode the previous explanation of the labelling in a variable named %rule%. Whenever I use %rule% in a text, you should follow the exact rules I specified
above.
response: Certainly, I understand your request. You want me to label comments in a comment tree based on specific criteria as described in your %rule%. Please provide the comment tree, and I will label each comment accordingly based on the provided criteria.
