prompt: Hello ChatGPT. I want you remember all your knowledge in competitive programming and help me label a couple of things. 

I will give you a comment tree from Codeforces from a specific blog round. I want you to label each comment from the tree based on the following labels SolutionExp, HintExp, AlgoExp, TimeComExp, FixingExp, TextExp, QuestionExp, SubQuestion, TestQuestion, Irrelevant. A short description of the labels can be seen below :

SolutionExp  -  A comment which explains in detail how to solve a problem, more like a step by step guide. 
HintExp   -  It can be viewed as a sparse variant of SolutionExp in which just various elements from an entire solution are presented. 
AlgoExp   -  A comment which states the algorithm used and the submission link with little to no information. 
TimeComExp  - A comment which states the complexity and the submission link with little to no information.
FixingExp   - A comment which explains or gives a hint in how to solve a specific bug in an implementation
TextExp    - A comment which explains the result of an output test for a given problem. 
QuestionExp   -  A relevant question about a specific problem in the contest. It should have a relevant answer in comment subtree.
SubQuestion  -  A comment which asks insights about why a submission fails. 
TestQuestion  -  A comment which asks insights about the result of a specific input test. 
Irrelevant   -  Any other comment which doesn't fit in the labels defined above.  

A comment from the tree will have the following structure:
(Id of the father comment or -1 if the comment is a root, id of a comment) -> the text of the comment.


The conversation from now on will be like this: I will provide a comment tree, you will label it.

For example:
(-1, 2233) => I really loved this round!.
(2233,  3312) => Yeah it was pretty cool especially problem C which can be solved  with binary search. <submission link>.
(-1, 2444) => Here is how I solved problem C. The problem gives as multiple queries and an array. Each query asks us to see if an element is in
the array or not. To solve the problem, I sorted the array in ascending order using merge sort and for each query I used binary search to find
if the element is in array or not. Total complexity is $$$N*log(N) + Q*log(N)$$$. Here is my submission: <submission link>
(2444, 2467) => There is no need to solve the problem using sorting and binary search, a hash can suffice.
(2444, 2468) => I solved the problem in O(n). Here is my submission <submission link>
(-1, 2313) => How to solve problem D??
(-1, 2314) => Can somebody tell me why I am getting wrong answer on preset 3, here is my submission <submission link>
(2314, 2315) => You should do floating division and not integer division.
(-1, 2316) => Why the result in the first test case is 1 and not 3?
(2316, 2317) => In the statement it says that odd numbers should be counted.

The result should be of the following form. As noted instead of displaying the comment text, you should display the label:
(-1, 2233) => Irrelevant.
(2233, 3312) => AlgoExp
(-1, 2444) => SolutionExp
(2444, 2467) => HintExp
(2444, 2468) => TimeComExp
(-1, 2313) => QuestionExp
(-1, 2314) => SubQuestion
(2314, 2315) => FixingExp
(-1, 2316) => TestQuestion
(2316,2317) => TextExp

Please encode the previous explanation of the labelling in a variable named %rule%. Whenever I use %rule% in a text, you should follow the exact rules I specified
above.
response: Of course, I understand your request. Please provide the comment tree from Codeforces, and I will label each comment according to the rules you specified in %rule%.

((906260, 906461)) => <p>In fact, when $$$n &gt; k^2$$$ holds, the answer is a $$$O(k)$$$-degree polynomial. So you can use lagrange interpolation to solve this problem without precalc.</p>

prompt: %rule%
((-1, 906262)) => <p>An interesting thing about problem b I found, the difference between the first element and the last element cannot exceed $$$n + 1$$$. as long as the difference is less than or equal to $$$n + 1$$$ the answer is always yes. I'm not the best at proofs, but I think this is because the greatest difference between a series of $$$n$$$ consecutive integers is always $$$n - 1$$$, and our operations can increase the first element by one and decrease the last element by one, thereby shrinking the maximum difference between elements by two at most. So if the maximum difference is greater than $$$n - 1 + 2$$$ then the answer is no. What I can't figure out is why the ones in the middle can always seem to fix themselves if this is true. Still, this solution works in $$$O(1)$$$.</p> <p> <submission link> </p>
((906262, 906345)) => <p>Basically you are describing the same equation as the one in the solution: x[n-1]-x[0]-n+1 &lt;= 2 &lt;=&gt; x[n-1]-x[0] &lt;= n+1</p> <p>I actually solved this like a dumb person by shifting x[0] to the right or keeping it where it is and checking if everyone of the next elements can be shifted to the proper position according to where x[0] is fixed. So my complexity is O(2n) = O(n). Still works since reading the input is also O(n), but my solution is roughly 3 times slower than necessary.</p> <p>From my understanding, the solution described by the creator of the problem refers only to how many gaps there are between the first and last elements. If there are 0 gaps we're done, if there's one we can just shift one side and connect it with the other and if there are 2 gaps we shift 2 "chunks" so that everything is connected. On the other hand, if there are 3 or more gaps (which will make the inequality you referred to become false), then if one thinks about it, he will realize that there is no way to shift those 3 or more "chunks" in a way that they can be consecutive.</p> <p>The O(1) solution blew my mind on how simple it was. This problem caused me to overthink :D</p>

((-1, 906547)) => <p>Can someone help me see where my B problem is going wrong，This caused my crash and lower rate  <submission link> </p>
((906547, 906552)) => <p>This happens because if the answer is <code>NO</code> your code goes to end and doesn't input remaining numbers. So they will be in the next test case and all numeration of the input numbers breaks so your code gots WA. To fix it your need to input ALL numbers even if the answer is <code>NO</code> now.</p>
((906552, 906555)) => <p>Thank you very much! ! ！ It was a stupid mistake T_T</p>
((906552, 906558)) => <p>I modified it, but it still seems to have a problem  <submission link> </p>
((906558, 906566)) => <p>This happens because your solution can print two <code>NO</code> instead one. You must append the word <code>continue;</code> after the first check in cycle to not run the second check if the first check is already <code>NO</code>. And you will get AC then.</p>
((906566, 906569)) => <p>yes,you are right,i must thank you again!</p>

prompt: %rule%
((-1, 907025)) => <p>In A it is said that (ans = false) if s[i] != s[i+1]. But what if in test 1, aaaabbb, when it runs from a to b (aaaABbb) it's false and it cout "NO" ?, I think I'm understanding it wrong, can someone pls help</p>
((907025, 907323)) => <ul> <li>if (s[i] != s[i+1] and s[i] != s[i-1])</li> <li>ans = false</li> </ul> <p>It's also better to draw 1 upper-case character to understand this better. So when you're in "aaaAbbb" you check if(a != b and a != a) =&gt; if(true and false) =&gt; if(false) So the answer doesn't become "NO". You don't enter the if statement and the answer remains "YES".</p> <p>Remember, when you have statements separated by "and" operators, all of them need to be true for the whole statement to be true. I think if you put some more thought into it you will get it.</p> <p>In case this implementation confuses you:</p>   <ul> <li>for j in range(n):</li> <li>if (j == 0 or s[j] != s[j — 1]) and (j == n — 1 or s[j] != s[j + 1]):</li> <li>ans = False</li> </ul> <p>keep in mind that "j == 0" and "j == n-1" statements only help for the extreme cases. In our example, for "Aaaabbb" and "aaaabbB". In those special cases we only check one neighbour.</p>
