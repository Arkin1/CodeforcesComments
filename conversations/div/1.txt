prompt: Hello ChatGPT. I want you remember all your knowledge in competitive programming and help me label a couple of things. 

I will give you a comment tree from Codeforces from a specific blog round. I want you to label each comment from the tree based on the following labels SolutionExp, HintExp, AlgoExp, TimeComExp, FixingExp, TextExp, QuestionExp, SubQuestion, TestQuestion, Irrelevant. A short description of the labels can be seen below :

SolutionExp  -  A comment which explains in detail how to solve a problem, more like a step by step guide. 
HintExp   -  It can be viewed as a sparse variant of SolutionExp in which just various elements from an entire solution are presented. 
AlgoExp   -  A comment which states the algorithm used and the submission link with little to no information. 
TimeComExp  - A comment which states the complexity and the submission link with little to no information.
FixingExp   - A comment which explains or gives a hint in how to solve a specific bug in an implementation
TextExp    - A comment which explains the result of an output test for a given problem. 
QuestionExp   -  A relevant question about a specific problem in the contest. It should have a relevant answer in comment subtree.
SubQuestion  -  A comment which asks insights about why a submission fails. 
TestQuestion  -  A comment which asks insights about the result of a specific input test. 
Irrelevant   -  Any other comment which doesn't fit in the labels defined above.  

A comment from the tree will have the following structure:
(Id of the father comment or -1 if the comment is a root, id of a comment) -> the text of the comment.


The conversation from now on will be like this: I will provide a comment tree, you will label it.

For example:
(-1, 2233) => I really loved this round!.
(2233,  3312) => Yeah it was pretty cool especially problem C which can be solved  with binary search. <submission link>.
(-1, 2444) => Here is how I solved problem C. The problem gives as multiple queries and an array. Each query asks us to see if an element is in
the array or not. To solve the problem, I sorted the array in ascending order using merge sort and for each query I used binary search to find
if the element is in array or not. Total complexity is $$$N*log(N) + Q*log(N)$$$. Here is my submission: <submission link>
(2444, 2467) => There is no need to solve the problem using sorting and binary search, a hash can suffice.
(2444, 2468) => I solved the problem in O(n). Here is my submission <submission link>
(-1, 2313) => How to solve problem D??
(-1, 2314) => Can somebody tell me why I am getting wrong answer on preset 3, here is my submission <submission link>
(2314, 2315) => You should do floating division and not integer division.
(-1, 2316) => Why the result in the first test case is 1 and not 3?
(2316, 2317) => In the statement it says that odd numbers should be counted.

The result should be of the following form. As noted instead of displaying the comment text, you should display the label:
(-1, 2233) => Irrelevant.
(2233, 3312) => AlgoExp
(-1, 2444) => SolutionExp
(2444, 2467) => HintExp
(2444, 2468) => TimeComExp
(-1, 2313) => QuestionExp
(-1, 2314) => SubQuestion
(2314, 2315) => FixingExp
(-1, 2316) => TestQuestion
(2316,2317) => TextExp

Please encode the previous explanation of the labelling in a variable named %rule%. Whenever I use %rule% in a text, you should follow the exact rules I specified
above.
response: Certainly, I understand your request. You'd like me to label comments in a comment tree from Codeforces based on specific categories. Here are the labels for each comment in the provided example:

((942614, 942656)) => <div class="ttypography"><p>Yea, but for most easy problems usually the gap between intuition and formal proof is not this large.

Even without that intuition, trying it on a few small examples should quickly demonstrate this trend. Add in the observation that adjacent numbers have a GCD of 1 (so none of the factors are &quot;wasted&quot; by the LCM) and we have a straightforward solution that's very easy to implement. </p><p>I didn't prove it during the contest myself, and that did cause me to hesitate before submission, but the intuition was strong enough that I decided to go ahead anyway. </p></div>

By Rearrangement Inequality, in any optional permutation, if $$$i&lt;j$$$ and none of $$$p_i$$$ and $$$p_j$$$ are equal to $$$i$$$ or $$$j$$$, then we must have $$$p_i&lt;p_j$$$. In particular, if $$$p_i=n$$$, then we must have $$$i=n-1$$$ or $$$i=n-2$$$. In addition, setting $$$j=n$$$ gives $$$p_n=n-1,n-2$$$. This implies that in an optimal permutation there are very limited possibilities for the last few elements of the permutation. We can use induction to prove that the best possibility is $$$p_n=n-1$$$ and $$$p_{n-1}=n$$$, so then we can construct an optimal permutation this way.</p></div></div></div>

A short description of the labels can be seen below :

SolutionExp  -  A comment which explains in detail how to solve a problem, more like a step by step guide. 
HintExp   -  It can be viewed as a sparse variant of SolutionExp in which just various elements from an entire solution are presented. 
AlgoExp   -  A comment which states the algorithm used and the submission link with little to no information. 
TimeComExp  - A comment which states the complexity and the submission link with little to no information.
FixingExp   - A comment which explains or gives a hint in how to solve a specific bug in an implementation
TextExp    - A comment which explains the result of an output test for a given problem.

prompt: Hello ChatGPT. I want you remember all your knowledge in competitive programming and help me label a couple of things. 

I will give you a comment tree from Codeforces from a specific blog round. I want you to label each comment from the tree based on the following labels SolutionExp, HintExp, AlgoExp, TimeComExp, FixingExp, TextExp, QuestionExp, SubQuestion, TestQuestion, Irrelevant. A short description of the labels can be seen below :

SolutionExp  -  A comment which explains in detail how to solve a problem, more like a step by step guide. 
HintExp   -  It can be viewed as a sparse variant of SolutionExp in which just various elements from an entire solution are presented. 
AlgoExp   -  A comment which states the algorithm used and the submission link with little to no information. 
TimeComExp  - A comment which states the complexity and the submission link with little to no information.
FixingExp   - A comment which explains or gives a hint in how to solve a specific bug in an implementation
TextExp    - A comment which explains the result of an output test for a given problem. 
QuestionExp   -  A relevant question about a specific problem in the contest. It should have a relevant answer in comment subtree.
SubQuestion  -  A comment which asks insights about why a submission fails. 
TestQuestion  -  A comment which asks insights about the result of a specific input test. 
Irrelevant   -  Any other comment which doesn't fit in the labels defined above.  

A comment from the tree will have the following structure:
(Id of the father comment or -1 if the comment is a root, id of a comment) -> the text of the comment.


The conversation from now on will be like this: I will provide a comment tree, you will label it.

For example:
(-1, 2233) => I really loved this round!.
(2233,  3312) => Yeah it was pretty cool especially problem C which can be solved  with binary search. <submission link>.
(-1, 2444) => Here is how I solved problem C. The problem gives as multiple queries and an array. Each query asks us to see if an element is in
the array or not. To solve the problem, I sorted the array in ascending order using merge sort and for each query I used binary search to find
if the element is in array or not. Total complexity is $$$N*log(N) + Q*log(N)$$$. Here is my submission: <submission link>
(2444, 2467) => There is no need to solve the problem using sorting and binary search, a hash can suffice.
(2444, 2468) => I solved the problem in O(n). Here is my submission <submission link>
(-1, 2313) => How to solve problem D??
(-1, 2314) => Can somebody tell me why I am getting wrong answer on preset 3, here is my submission <submission link>
(2314, 2315) => You should do floating division and not integer division.
(-1, 2316) => Why the result in the first test case is 1 and not 3?
(2316, 2317) => In the statement it says that odd numbers should be counted.

The result should be of the following form. As noted instead of displaying the comment text, you should display the label:
(-1, 2233) => Irrelevant.
(2233, 3312) => AlgoExp
(-1, 2444) => SolutionExp
(2444, 2467) => HintExp
(2444, 2468) => TimeComExp
(-1, 2313) => QuestionExp
(-1, 2314) => SubQuestion
(2314, 2315) => FixingExp
(-1, 2316) => TestQuestion
(2316,2317) => TextExp

Please encode the previous explanation of the labelling in a variable named %rule%. Whenever I use %rule% in a text, you should follow the exact rules I specified
above.
response: Certainly! I understand your request. Please provide the comment tree, and I will label each comment based on the rules you've provided using %rule%.
If you could provide the comment tree in the format you mentioned earlier, I'll start labeling them accordingly.

if the element is in array or not. Total complexity is $$$N*log(N) + Q*log(N)$$$. Here is my submission: <submission link>
(2444, 2467) => There is no need to solve the problem using sorting and binary search, a hash can suffice.

(2314, 2315) => You should do floating division and not integer division.
(-1, 2316) => Why the result in the first test case is 1 and not 3?
(2316, 2317) => In the statement it says that odd numbers should be counted.

The result should be of the following form. As noted instead of displaying the comment text, you should display the label:

((948121, 948223)) => <div class="ttypography"><p>This is somewhat similar to the binary search solution. In it you change the smallest values such that all $$$a_i \ge \frac{ans}{2}$$$, and then cleverly choose which remaining values to change. Turns out that there are only two cases: zero values left or $$$\ge$$$ one value left, so in our greedy solution, we also leave one value to do something with, hence we change the $$$k - 1$$$ smallest values.</p></div>
