prompt: Hello ChatGPT. I want you remember all your knowledge in competitive programming and help me label a couple of things. 

I will give you a comment tree from Codeforces from a specific blog round. I want you to label each comment from the tree based on the following labels SolutionExp, HintExp, AlgoExp, TimeComExp, FixingExp, TextExp, QuestionExp, SubQuestion, TestQuestion, Irrelevant. A short description of the labels can be seen below :

SolutionExp  -  A comment which explains in detail how to solve a problem, more like a step by step guide. 
HintExp   -  It can be viewed as a sparse variant of SolutionExp in which just various elements from an entire solution are presented. 
AlgoExp   -  A comment which states the algorithm used and the submission link with little to no information. 
TimeComExp  - A comment which states the complexity and the submission link with little to no information.
FixingExp   - A comment which explains or gives a hint in how to solve a specific bug in an implementation
TextExp    - A comment which explains the result of an output test for a given problem. 
QuestionExp   -  A relevant question about a specific problem in the contest. It should have a relevant answer in comment subtree.
SubQuestion  -  A comment which asks insights about why a submission fails. 
TestQuestion  -  A comment which asks insights about the result of a specific input test. 
Irrelevant   -  Any other comment which doesn't fit in the labels defined above.  

A comment from the tree will have the following structure:
(Id of the father comment or -1 if the comment is a root, id of a comment) -> the text of the comment.


The conversation from now on will be like this: I will provide a comment tree, you will label it.

For example:
(-1, 2233) => I really loved this round!.
(2233,  3312) => Yeah it was pretty cool especially problem C which can be solved  with binary search. <submission link>.
(-1, 2444) => Here is how I solved problem C. The problem gives as multiple queries and an array. Each query asks us to see if an element is in
the array or not. To solve the problem, I sorted the array in ascending order using merge sort and for each query I used binary search to find
if the element is in array or not. Total complexity is $$$N*log(N) + Q*log(N)$$$. Here is my submission: <submission link>
(2444, 2467) => There is no need to solve the problem using sorting and binary search, a hash can suffice.
(2444, 2468) => I solved the problem in O(n). Here is my submission <submission link>
(-1, 2313) => How to solve problem D??
(-1, 2314) => Can somebody tell me why I am getting wrong answer on preset 3, here is my submission <submission link>
(2314, 2315) => You should do floating division and not integer division.
(-1, 2316) => Why the result in the first test case is 1 and not 3?
(2316, 2317) => In the statement it says that odd numbers should be counted.

The result should be of the following form. As noted instead of displaying the comment text, you should display the label:
(-1, 2233) => Irrelevant.
(2233, 3312) => AlgoExp
(-1, 2444) => SolutionExp
(2444, 2467) => HintExp
(2444, 2468) => TimeComExp
(-1, 2313) => QuestionExp
(-1, 2314) => SubQuestion
(2314, 2315) => FixingExp
(-1, 2316) => TestQuestion
(2316,2317) => TextExp

Please encode the previous explanation of the labelling in a variable named %rule%. Whenever I use %rule% in a text, you should follow the exact rules I specified
above.

((-1, 944797)) => <div class="ttypography"><p>I can't get the editorial of Problem E. Is it too simple or poorly explained? Can somebody please explain the solution ?</p></div>
((944797, 945106)) => <div class="ttypography"><p>There is a trivial case when the number of distinct values ($$$d$$$) is less than $$$k$$$. In that case we have to increase this value. So the best way to do is by doing $$$d - k$$$ operations of choosing $$$1 \times 1$$$ matrices and setting some values.</p><p>Now, if $$$d \ge k$$$, it can be proven that the answer is at max $$$2$$$. Let's prove it. Choose a submatrix of size $$$L$$$ from the top left corner such that colouring the entire submatrix to some new colour makes the new value of $$$d$$$ at least $$$k$$$. We will choose the maximum possible such $$$L$$$. Since $$$L$$$ is the maximum possible, if we increase it by even one more, we will end up getting $$$d &lt; k$$$. This means that the extra row and extra column that we are adding by shifting from $$$L$$$ to $$$L + 1$$$ contains a some distinct values that makes the value of $$$d$$$ cross over $$$k$$$ in a big jump. We only need to change some of these values. So we are looking from small jump instead of this big jump.</p><p>So instead of changing these extra values from the top left, let's try to change them from the bottom right i.e. in our second operation we will choose a different submatrix such that it's bottom right corner lies at $$$(L, L)$$$ (the intersection of the row and column that makes all the difference). Notice, that we can tweak the size of this second operation submatrix to our own choice such that we can make a jump as close as possible to $$$k$$$. Increasing the length of this submatrix, can atmost create a difference of $$$2$$$ (one in row and one in column). So we can land our $$$d$$$ at $$$k$$$ or at $$$k - 1$$$. If we land at $$$k$$$, we're good to go but if we land at $$$k - 1$$$, we will still be good to go since, we can change the colour of this second operation to some new colour altogether which will increment our $$$d$$$ to $$$k$$$.</p><p>So it has been proven that we can obtain the final state in atmost two operations.</p><p>Let's first define a term I'll call complete coverage. A submatrix $$$S$$$ is said to completely cover a value $$$v$$$ if the complement of the submatrix (w.r.t. the original matrix) does not contain the value $$$v$$$ at all. Another term, I'll define is bounding box. The bounding box of a value is the smallest matrix that completely covers it.</p><p>Now, we have to find out whether we can get the answer in one operation or not else the answer will be two. For the one operation that we want to do, we can iterate over the length $$$len$$$ of the submatrix of the operation and check whether there exists a submatrix such that treating it as our operation gives us the final state. For each possible length, we can iterate over all the possible values in the matrix and figure out which submatrices of size $$$len$$$ will completely cover this value. If we find a submatrix which completely covers exactly $$$d - k$$$ or $$$d - k + 1$$$ values, we can do 1 operation on this submatrix and get the new value of $$$d$$$ to be equal to $$$k$$$. We can do this in $$$O(n^2)$$$ time using 2D Lazy Addition using Prefix Sums (explained below). So this gives a total of $$$O(n^3)$$$ time complexity.</p><p>For finding the number of complete coverages for each submatrix, what we can do is we can represent the submatrix firstly by just it's top-left cell. Now, for each value, we can calculate it's bounding box. We will use 2D Lazy Update on the extreme corners of this bounding box to add 1 (the submatrices of length $$$len$$$ that contain this bounding box have 1 more value completely covered). And then we can calculate 2D prefix sum to get the final number of complete coverages.</p><p> <submission link> </p></div>

prompt: Hello ChatGPT. I want you remember all your knowledge in competitive programming and help me label a couple of things. 

I will give you a comment tree from Codeforces from a specific blog round. I want you to label each comment from the tree based on the following labels SolutionExp, HintExp, AlgoExp, TimeComExp, FixingExp, TextExp, QuestionExp, SubQuestion, TestQuestion, Irrelevant. A short description of the labels can be seen below :

SolutionExp  -  A comment which explains in detail how to solve a problem, more like a step by step guide. 
HintExp   -  It can be viewed as a sparse variant of SolutionExp in which just various elements from an entire solution are presented. 
AlgoExp   -  A comment which states the algorithm used and the submission link with little to no information. 
TimeComExp  - A comment which states the complexity and the submission link with little to no information.
FixingExp   - A comment which explains or gives a hint in how to solve a specific bug in an implementation
TextExp    - A comment which explains the result of an output test for a given problem. 
QuestionExp   -  A relevant question about a specific problem in the contest. It should have a relevant answer in comment subtree.
SubQuestion  -  A comment which asks insights about why a submission fails. 
TestQuestion  -  A comment which asks insights about the result of a specific input test. 
Irrelevant   -  Any other comment which doesn't fit in the labels defined above.  

A comment from the tree will have the following structure:
(Id of the father comment or -1 if the comment is a root, id of a comment) -> the text of the comment.


The conversation from now on will be like this: I will provide a comment tree, you will label it.

For example:
(-1, 2233) => I really loved this round!.
(2233,  3312) => Yeah it was pretty cool especially problem C which can be solved  with binary search. <submission link>.
(-1, 2444) => Here is how I solved problem C. The problem gives as multiple queries and an array. Each query asks us to see if an element is in
the array or not. To solve the problem, I sorted the array in ascending order using merge sort and for each query I used binary search to find
if the element is in array or not. Total complexity is $$$N*log(N) + Q*log(N)$$$. Here is my submission: <submission link>
(2444, 2467) => There is no need to solve the problem using sorting and binary search, a hash can suffice.
(2444, 2468) => I solved the problem in O(n). Here is my submission <submission link>
(-1, 2313) => How to solve problem D??
(-1, 2314) => Can somebody tell me why I am getting wrong answer on preset 3, here is my submission <submission link>
(2314, 2315) => You should do floating division and not integer division.
(-1, 2316) => Why the result in the first test case is 1 and not 3?
(2316, 2317) => In the statement it says that odd numbers should be counted.

The result should be of the following form. As noted instead of displaying the comment text, you should display the label:
(-1, 2233) => Irrelevant.
(2233, 3312) => AlgoExp
(-1, 2444) => SolutionExp
(2444, 2467) => HintExp
(2444, 2468) => TimeComExp
(-1, 2313) => QuestionExp
(-1, 2314) => SubQuestion
(2314, 2315) => FixingExp
(-1, 2316) => TestQuestion
(2316,2317) => TextExp

Please encode the previous explanation of the labelling in a variable named %rule%. Whenever I use %rule% in a text, you should follow the exact rules I specified
above.
response: Certainly, I understand your request. You want me to label each comment in a given comment tree based on the labels you provided. Here's the result for the example comments you provided following the rules in %rule%:
(-1, 2233) => Irrelevant.
(2233, 3312) => AlgoExp
(-1, 2444) => SolutionExp

(2444, 2468) => TimeComExp
(-1, 2313) => QuestionExp
(-1, 2314) => SubQuestion
(2314, 2315) => FixingExp
(-1, 2316) => TestQuestion
(2316, 2317) => TextExp
If you provide a new comment tree, I'll be happy to label it following the same rules.

((944839, 944849)) => <div class="ttypography"><p>Suppose you have two 0s that are next to each other, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Then either the entire matrix is filled with 0s, or there exists a 1 that can be covered by an L-piece that also covers 2 zeros. The nice thing is that even after covering this 1, the property must continue to hold, so there is another 1 that can be covered by a single L-piece that also covers 2 zeros, and so on. As a result, if there are $$$k$$$ 1s in the matrix, then we can perform $$$k$$$ operations to zero them all, covering exactly one 1 with each operation. Try this out with Sample Input #2.</p><p>But if you don't have two 0s aligned (horizontally, vertically or diagonally) at first, then you have to place the first piece in an area with two 1s (if a 0 exists), or in an area with three 1s (if there is no 0 at all initially). After that, however, the remaining 1s can be covered one at a time. </p><p>Basically: if there exists two 0s aligned horizontally/vertically/diagonally, then the answer is the number of 1s initially. Otherwise, if there exists at least one 0, then the answer is (number of 1s) minus 1. Otherwise, if there is no 0, then the answer is (number of 1s) minus 2.</p></div>

prompt: %rule%
((-1, 944852)) => <div class="ttypography"><p>I hate to say this but I believe the statement for B isn't clear enough. When I read the equation to determine beauty of subsegment, I thought it's max(a) — min(a) + max(a[l:r]) — min(a[l:r]). So my intuition to that problem is we want the subsegment to be as long as possible since we can include more elements for the max of the subsegment to be bigger and min to be smaller. So what I thought was that the answer max of max(a) — min(a) + max(a[1:n-1]) — min(a[1:n-1]) and max(a) — min(a) + max(a[2:n]) — min(a[2:n]). (Here [l:r] both sides are inclusive) But it turned out to be different and I still can't turn my head around that.

((944852, 945327)) => <div class="ttypography"><p>The reason it's different is that your formula is slightly wrong. Instead of the max and min of a, the first two terms should be the max and min of a <em>excluding the subsegment [l, r]</em>.

prompt: Hello ChatGPT. I want you remember all your knowledge in competitive programming and help me label a couple of things. 

I will give you a comment tree from Codeforces from a specific blog round. I want you to label each comment from the tree based on the following labels SolutionExp, HintExp, AlgoExp, TimeComExp, FixingExp, TextExp, QuestionExp, SubQuestion, TestQuestion, Irrelevant. A short description of the labels can be seen below :

SolutionExp  -  A comment which explains in detail how to solve a problem, more like a step by step guide. 
HintExp   -  It can be viewed as a sparse variant of SolutionExp in which just various elements from an entire solution are presented. 
AlgoExp   -  A comment which states the algorithm used and the submission link with little to no information. 
TimeComExp  - A comment which states the complexity and the submission link with little to no information.
FixingExp   - A comment which explains or gives a hint in how to solve a specific bug in an implementation
TextExp    - A comment which explains the result of an output test for a given problem. 
QuestionExp   -  A relevant question about a specific problem in the contest. It should have a relevant answer in comment subtree.
SubQuestion  -  A comment which asks insights about why a submission fails. 
TestQuestion  -  A comment which asks insights about the result of a specific input test. 
Irrelevant   -  Any other comment which doesn't fit in the labels defined above.  

A comment from the tree will have the following structure:
(Id of the father comment or -1 if the comment is a root, id of a comment) -> the text of the comment.


The conversation from now on will be like this: I will provide a comment tree, you will label it.

For example:
(-1, 2233) => I really loved this round!.
(2233,  3312) => Yeah it was pretty cool especially problem C which can be solved  with binary search. <submission link>.
(-1, 2444) => Here is how I solved problem C. The problem gives as multiple queries and an array. Each query asks us to see if an element is in
the array or not. To solve the problem, I sorted the array in ascending order using merge sort and for each query I used binary search to find
if the element is in array or not. Total complexity is $$$N*log(N) + Q*log(N)$$$. Here is my submission: <submission link>
(2444, 2467) => There is no need to solve the problem using sorting and binary search, a hash can suffice.
(2444, 2468) => I solved the problem in O(n). Here is my submission <submission link>
(-1, 2313) => How to solve problem D??
(-1, 2314) => Can somebody tell me why I am getting wrong answer on preset 3, here is my submission <submission link>
(2314, 2315) => You should do floating division and not integer division.
(-1, 2316) => Why the result in the first test case is 1 and not 3?
(2316, 2317) => In the statement it says that odd numbers should be counted.

The result should be of the following form. As noted instead of displaying the comment text, you should display the label:
(-1, 2233) => Irrelevant.
(2233, 3312) => AlgoExp
(-1, 2444) => SolutionExp
(2444, 2467) => HintExp
(2444, 2468) => TimeComExp
(-1, 2313) => QuestionExp
(-1, 2314) => SubQuestion
(2314, 2315) => FixingExp
(-1, 2316) => TestQuestion
(2316,2317) => TextExp

Please encode the previous explanation of the labelling in a variable named %rule%. Whenever I use %rule% in a text, you should follow the exact rules I specified
above.
response: Understood! Please provide the comment tree from the Codeforces blog round, and I will label each comment based on the rules you've specified using %rule%.

(Id of the father comment or -1 if the comment is a root, id of a comment) -> the text of the comment.


The conversation from now on will be like this: I will provide a comment tree, you will label it.

For example:
(-1, 2233) => I really loved this round!.
(2233,  3312) => Yeah it was pretty cool especially problem C which can be solved  with binary search. <submission link>.
(-1, 2444) => Here is how I solved problem C. The problem gives as multiple queries and an array. Each query asks us to see if an element is in
the array or not. To solve the problem, I sorted the array in ascending order using merge sort and for each query I used binary search to find
if the element is in array or not. Total complexity is $$$N*log(N) + Q*log(N)$$$. Here is my submission: <submission link>
(2444, 2467) => There is no need to solve the problem using sorting and binary search, a hash can suffice.
(2444, 2468) => I solved the problem in O(n). Here is my submission <submission link>
(-1, 2313) => How to solve problem D??
(-1, 2314) => Can somebody tell me why I am getting wrong answer on preset 3, here is my submission <submission link>
(2314, 2315) => You should do floating division and not integer division.
(-1, 2316) => Why the result in the first test case is 1 and not 3?
(2316, 2317) => In the statement it says that odd numbers should be counted.

The result should be of the following form. As noted instead of displaying the comment text, you should display the label:
(-1, 2233) => Irrelevant.
(2233, 3312) => AlgoExp
(-1, 2444) => SolutionExp
(2444, 2467) => HintExp

((944948, 944972)) => <div class="ttypography"><p>We can build the longest subsequence iteratively by sweeping from $$$0$$$ to $$$n$$$ and finding the longest subsequence so far that our current index(lets call it $$$i$$$) can add on to. Naively, this is $$$dp$$$ solution is $$$O(n^2)$$$. </p><p>The main intuition behind the speedup to this problem is that, when comparing two numbers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in their binary representation, the only important digit $$$k$$$ is the first digit where they differ. Conveniently, there are only 30 possible values of $$$k$$$. This motivates us to use a binary trie that stores prefixes, and for each prefix we can keep track of the maximum $$$dp$$$ value where some bitstring with said prefix exists. </p><p>However, how do we know if for some digit $$$k$$$, the required configuration of $$$j$$$ and $$$a_j$$$ such that we satisfy the inequality $$$a_j \oplus i &lt; a_i \oplus j$$$? Let's do some casework and see if that simplifies anything. </p><p>Case 1: $$$k$$$ is off in both $$$i$$$ and $$$a_i$$$. </p><p>In this case, to satisfy the inequality, we want the kth bit to be set in $$$a_i \oplus j$$$ but not $$$a_j \oplus i$$$, so the kth bit should be set in $$$j$$$ but not in $$$a_j$$$. We can then update $$$dp_i$$$ accordingly. To figure out which subtree of the trie we should descend to, note that the prefixes of $$$a_j \oplus i$$$ and $$$a_i \oplus j$$$ should remain identical, so we want the status of $$$k$$$ in $$$a_j$$$ and $$$j$$$ to be the same. This raises a little bit of a problem, since this is two subtrees that we must visit. For now, lets look at the other cases.</p><p>Case 2: $$$k$$$ is off in $$$i$$$ but on in $$$a_i$$$:</p><p>In this case, to satisfy the inequality, $$$k$$$ should be off in both bits. The subtrees that we must descend to (so we can find answers where the differing digit between $$$a_j \oplus i$$$ and $$$a_i \oplus j$$$ is greater than k) are those where $$$k$$$ is on in one of $$$j$$$ or $$$a_j$$$ but off in the other.</p><p>Case 3: $$$k$$$ is on in $$$i$$$ but off in $$$a_i$$$: </p><p>Here, to satisfy the inequality, we want the kth bit to be on in both bits. The subtrees that we should descend to are those where the $$$k$$$ bits differ.</p><p>Case 4: $$$k$$$ is on in both bits. </p><p>And lastly, for this case, the kth bit should be on in $$$a_j$$$ but off in $$$j$$$. The subtrees that we should descend to are the ones where the kth bits are the same.</p><p>We can notice one major observation so that we only visit one subtree, instead of $$$2$$$: only the value of $$$a_j \oplus j$$$ matters, since we wish to make the prefixes indentical. </p><p>However, then there is the final question of, for the subtree that we don't visit, how do we know if the maximum $$$dp$$$ value is valid? For example, if we are on the kth bit where it is off in both $$$i$$$ and $$$a_i$$$, the maximal $$$dp$$$ value may have some configuration where the kth bit is on in $$$a_j$$$ and not $$$j$$$. This will obviously cause $$$a_j \oplus i$$$ to be greater than $$$a_i \oplus j$$$. Well, thankfully, there are only 2 possible configurations for such a subtree where $$$a_j$$$ and $$$j$$$ differ in their kth bit: either $$$a_j$$$ has the kth bit set and $$$j$$$ doesn't, or $$$j$$$ has the kth bit set and $$$a_j$$$ doesn't. Similarly, for the subtree where $$$j$$$ and $$$a_j$$$ have the same status for their kth bit, there are only two cases: either it is set in both or off in both. So we can keep track of such $$$dp$$$ values separately.</p><p>So, our trie nodes only need to know: The child where the next bit is indentical in $$$a_j \oplus j$$$, the child where the kth bit differs, and the maximum dp values for the case where the kth bit is on in $$$j$$$, and the case where the kth bit is off.</p><p>When we are finished processing $$$i$$$, all we have to do is insert it into the trie and update the max $$$dp$$$ values accordingly. Then we can move on to $$$i+1$$$. The answer should obviously be the max value of $$$dp_i$$$ for all $$$i$$$. </p></div>
((944948, 944979)) => <div class="ttypography"><p>Our goal will be to calculate $$$dp[i]$$$, which is the longest valid subsequence starting at index $$$i$$$. We will calculate $$$dp[i]$$$ in decreasing order of $$$i$$$. In addition, we will maintain a trie which somehow stores elements of the array / $$$dp$$$ values. The flow of our solution would be something like:</p><p>a) For $$$0 \le i \le n - 1$$$: (decreasing)</p><p>a1) Calculate $$$dp[i]$$$ based on previous $$$dp$$$ values, using our trie.</p><p>a2) Insert the $$$i$$$'th element to the trie, somehow.</p><p>The $$$O(n^2)$$$ $$$dp$$$ formula is something like: $$$dp[i] = max_{j &gt; i, a[i] \oplus j &lt; a[j] \oplus i}(dp[j] + 1)$$$. Therefore, we want to insert the elements into the trie in such a way that retrieving the maximal $$$dp[j]$$$ for all $$$j$$$ such that $$$a[i] \oplus j &lt; a[j] \oplus i$$$ is easy.</p><p>Recall that comparing two binary numbers can be done lexicographically. Assume that up to the $$$k$$$'th leftmost bit, the two expressions are equal. Then, LHS will be smaller than RHS for some $$$(j, a[j])$$$ if and only if one of two happens:</p> <ol>   <li>$$$(a[i] \oplus j)_{k} = 0$$$ and $$$(a[j] \oplus i)_{k} = 1$$$.</li>   <li>$$$(a[i] \oplus j)_{k} = (a[j] \oplus i)_{k}$$$, and in a later bit, 1 happens.</li> </ol><p>The first condition is equivalent to $$$(a[i] \oplus i)_{k} \neq (a[j] \oplus j)_{k}$$$ and $$$a[j]_{k} \neq i_{k}$$$.

prompt: Hello ChatGPT. I want you remember all your knowledge in competitive programming and help me label a couple of things. 

I will give you a comment tree from Codeforces from a specific blog round. I want you to label each comment from the tree based on the following labels SolutionExp, HintExp, AlgoExp, TimeComExp, FixingExp, TextExp, QuestionExp, SubQuestion, TestQuestion, Irrelevant. A short description of the labels can be seen below :

SolutionExp  -  A comment which explains in detail how to solve a problem, more like a step by step guide. 
HintExp   -  It can be viewed as a sparse variant of SolutionExp in which just various elements from an entire solution are presented. 
AlgoExp   -  A comment which states the algorithm used and the submission link with little to no information. 
TimeComExp  - A comment which states the complexity and the submission link with little to no information.
FixingExp   - A comment which explains or gives a hint in how to solve a specific bug in an implementation
TextExp    - A comment which explains the result of an output test for a given problem. 
QuestionExp   -  A relevant question about a specific problem in the contest. It should have a relevant answer in comment subtree.
SubQuestion  -  A comment which asks insights about why a submission fails. 
TestQuestion  -  A comment which asks insights about the result of a specific input test. 
Irrelevant   -  Any other comment which doesn't fit in the labels defined above.  

A comment from the tree will have the following structure:
(Id of the father comment or -1 if the comment is a root, id of a comment) -> the text of the comment.


The conversation from now on will be like this: I will provide a comment tree, you will label it.

For example:

prompt: Hello ChatGPT. I want you remember all your knowledge in competitive programming and help me label a couple of things. 

I will give you a comment tree from Codeforces from a specific blog round. I want you to label each comment from the tree based on the following labels SolutionExp, HintExp, AlgoExp, TimeComExp, FixingExp, TextExp, QuestionExp, SubQuestion, TestQuestion, Irrelevant. A short description of the labels can be seen below :

SolutionExp  -  A comment which explains in detail how to solve a problem, more like a step by step guide. 
HintExp   -  It can be viewed as a sparse variant of SolutionExp in which just various elements from an entire solution are presented. 
AlgoExp   -  A comment which states the algorithm used and the submission link with little to no information. 
TimeComExp  - A comment which states the complexity and the submission link with little to no information.
FixingExp   - A comment which explains or gives a hint in how to solve a specific bug in an implementation
TextExp    - A comment which explains the result of an output test for a given problem. 
QuestionExp   -  A relevant question about a specific problem in the contest. It should have a relevant answer in comment subtree.
SubQuestion  -  A comment which asks insights about why a submission fails. 
TestQuestion  -  A comment which asks insights about the result of a specific input test. 
Irrelevant   -  Any other comment which doesn't fit in the labels defined above.  

A comment from the tree will have the following structure:
(Id of the father comment or -1 if the comment is a root, id of a comment) -> the text of the comment.


The conversation from now on will be like this: I will provide a comment tree, you will label it.

For example:
(-1, 2233) => I really loved this round!.
(2233,  3312) => Yeah it was pretty cool especially problem C which can be solved  with binary search. <submission link>.
(-1, 2444) => Here is how I solved problem C. The problem gives as multiple queries and an array. Each query asks us to see if an element is in
the array or not. To solve the problem, I sorted the array in ascending order using merge sort and for each query I used binary search to find
if the element is in array or not. Total complexity is $$$N*log(N) + Q*log(N)$$$. Here is my submission: <submission link>
(2444, 2467) => There is no need to solve the problem using sorting and binary search, a hash can suffice.
(2444, 2468) => I solved the problem in O(n). Here is my submission <submission link>
(-1, 2313) => How to solve problem D??
(-1, 2314) => Can somebody tell me why I am getting wrong answer on preset 3, here is my submission <submission link>
(2314, 2315) => You should do floating division and not integer division.
(-1, 2316) => Why the result in the first test case is 1 and not 3?
(2316, 2317) => In the statement it says that odd numbers should be counted.

The result should be of the following form. As noted instead of displaying the comment text, you should display the label:
(-1, 2233) => Irrelevant.
(2233, 3312) => AlgoExp
(-1, 2444) => SolutionExp
(2444, 2467) => HintExp
(2444, 2468) => TimeComExp
(-1, 2313) => QuestionExp
(-1, 2314) => SubQuestion
(2314, 2315) => FixingExp
(-1, 2316) => TestQuestion
(2316,2317) => TextExp

Please encode the previous explanation of the labelling in a variable named %rule%. Whenever I use %rule% in a text, you should follow the exact rules I specified
above.
response: Certainly! I understand your request. You can provide the comment tree, and I will label each comment according to the rules you specified in %rule%. Please go ahead and provide the comment tree, and I'll label it accordingly.
